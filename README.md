To trigger a new deploy, go [here](https://github.com/NEU-DSG/dailp-encoding/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) and click `Run workflow`.
This process pulls in all our annotated spreadsheets, converts them to TEI, converts the TEI to HTML, then deploys that to https://dailp-encoding.surge.sh.

  Encoding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19c_9KZw204aURzuo4f3kSQ8akNOlP-Cvq6L5JgtiOAw/edit#heading=h.3n95x3ez0syx):
