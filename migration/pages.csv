<p class=""text-center"" style=""text-align: left;"">DAILP is a community-based digital archive created to support indigenous peoples' knowledge, interpretations, and representations of the past.&nbsp; DAILP presents reading and writing environments for practicing indigenous languages. DAILP is building a collaborative online space to facilitate communications between indigenous language learners, speakers, and scholars. Contributors can interpret documents and other media housed in partner libraries and museums. The writing environment will allow users to create content presented in digital collections. Our inaugural collection offers insights into Cherokee life and language during the years after allotment in Indian Territory. DAILP code and workflows on GitHub are free. We're happy to help tribal communities stand up their own collectively held and curated archives for language persistence.</p>
<p>We've enhanced and deepened our collection of Cherokee language translations found on DAILP!&nbsp;<strong><i>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW)</i></strong> includes all the translations you're familiar with — the Dollie Duncan letters, Echota Funeral Notices, Willie Jumper Stories, and government documents. We've expanded our translations with new letters, funeral notices, stories, and speeches. We've also added new teaching materials in <strong><i>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW)</i></strong>.</p>

"dad54f62-1124-4536-b6db-a5dbae447d2d","goals","/about/goals","Goals","<p>DAILP stands for 'The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence.' Formerly the Digital Archive of American Indian Language Preservation and Perseverance, our name change reflects our belief that language perseverance and language preservation are closely interconnected and mutually-sustaining efforts, which result in language persistence. Our site presents a proof of concept for DAILP's reading interface using annotated Cherokee documents as a pilot. With the support of our sponsors, we have identified design functions and user configurations in order to create an online interface for community commentary.</p>
<p>The core goals of the Cherokee pilot project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deepen our existing <span style=""color: #9d4b42;"">community-centered design</span> workflows in partnership with the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes and representatives from their language programs. Support sustainable programs of transcription, translation and language learning that build on existing efforts within the Cherokee community.</li>
<li>Expand the number of documents collected in our <span style=""color: #9d4b42;"">digital collection</span> of historical Cherokee manuscripts. Transcribe, translate, and annotate documents to adapt them into resources for language learning and for linguistic and historical research, partnering with formal institutions to support ongoing collection development.</li>
<li>Build off of existing transcriptions and annotations to develop and sustain an online environment for contextualized language learning through a robust technical and informational infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>
<p>In addition to our core team, which consists of Cherokee language experts and linguists, we also work with speakers, archivists, and librarians. We have prototyped an online environment that supports varied reading and language study practices. Our reading interface is enhanced regularly to reflect feedback and recommendations from our team.</p>
<p>The Cherokee community has enhanced DAILP's design, contributing to our site in many ways. DAILP's work since 2015 has focused on developing workflows and infrastructure that align our source texts, translations, and linguistic annotations with descriptive resources and other materials shared with us by the Cherokee tribes and linguistic scholars. We have benefited from free translations of almost 70 Cherokee syllabary documents provided to us by a team of United Keetoowah Band tribal members led by Ernestine Berry and including Clara Proctor, Marlene Ballard, Oletta Pritchett, and the late Opel Foreman. These resources can be referenced from our transcriptions and translations as sources of information about individual words and usage.</p>
<hr />"
"6cfeda87-bd77-463b-9ab0-6def46c27406","project-history","/about/project-history","Project History","<h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
<p>Our initiative arose from and builds on work originating with indigenous peoples themselves. We closely involve tribal representatives in our design and conduct: our results are theirs. Although DAILP is hosted at Northeastern University, all aspects of the pilot of our site and subsequent use of our infrastructure takes their motivation and momentum from the work already being done by and in close collaboration with members of Indigenous Nations and communities.</p>
<p>DAILP builds on a 2014 IMLS SPARKS Ignition planning grant by Dr. Ellen Cushman with Gordon Henry at Michigan State University, ""Analyzing Ojibwe and Cherokee Manuscripts: Proof of Concept for a Digital Archive."" MSU faculty, tribal representatives, and Cherokee and Ojibwe community members created and tested designs for an interface to facilitate the translation of Cherokee and Ojibwe manuscripts housed in archives and libraries around the country.</p>
<p>In 2015 Cushman joined Northeastern University's English Department and began working with the library's Digital Scholarship Group (DSG) to explore the development of a full-scale archive of Cherokee manuscript documents aimed at language learning and language persistence. Linguistic information donated by the Cherokee Nation and linguists Hiroto Uchihara and Brad Montgomery-Anderson has contributed to the lexical data set that informs DAILP's translation process. In 2017-19, Cushman continued to develop collaborative partnerships with key archives and began the process of securing agreements to use materials at Yale's Beinecke Library. The documents presented in the reading interface of DAILP have been freely translated into English by Ernestine Berry and a team from the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians: Clara Proctor, Oleta Pritchett, Marlene Ballard. In 2021, under a Henry K. Luce Foundation grant, the team gathered initial feedback on the reader interface of DAILP and identified desired features of a collective translation online interface. This interface would facilitate both translation and growth of the current linguistic architecture, expanding the collection.</p>
<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
<p><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/"">Our collection</a> contains five different genres of Cherokee writing, including funeral notices, church notes, letters, stories, and government documents. Each document can be viewed in a multi-layered format that presents layers in increasing detail. From the story, pronunciation, and word parts to detailed linguistic analyses of each word, these documents to help readers better understand how words and phrases are created in the Cherokee language. We are working with tribal community partners, scholars, and archivists to make sure that our reading environment allows users to most effectively discover documents, read source documents and translations, search for words, and explore linguistic information.</p>
<h3>Where We're Headed</h3>
<p>Using the digital environment we've created so far, we will continue to work with both Cherokee community members and our advisory board to improve our understanding of how this online learning space can enhance existing language-related practices. We will also identify additional features that would improve translation, as well as language teaching and learning practices. To ensure that DAILP can be useful to a wide variety of audiences, our planning processes are conducted in collaboration with a variety of Cherokee language translators, readers, writers, and learners.</p>
<p>With support from the Henry K. Luce foundation, we are creating audio recordings of each source text to further enhance the site's documentation and presentation of the Cherokee language. We have also began integrating curricular materials onto our website, including exercises for writing practice alongside key cultural knowledge for understanding Cherokee people and culture. These curricular materials use our historical documents to help learners find, read, write, and understand Cherokee in new ways and will soon be expanded with listening exercises.</p>
<p>With support from the National Archives, we are also creating a digital edited collection titled <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em>. CWKW is rooted in the DAILP manuscript archive and its language data, but presents an expanded collection of documents through a reading framework that foregrounds genre, cultural thematics, scholarly and community contextualization, and commentary.</p>
<p>Our next major goal is to deepen our digital environment with a collaborative translation space where native speakers of the Cherokee language, learners and teachers, and scholars in the field can contribute their knowledge. This will allow users to both annotate documents at the character, word, phrase, and document levels and to discuss these annotations with others as a way of building knowledge and continually developing documentation of the Cherokee language.</p>"

<p>As is the case with most indigenous languages, the vitality of the Cherokee language has never been more precarious. The COVID pandemic has taken its toll on Cherokee communities by accelerating the already rapid loss of Cherokee speakers. It is becoming increasingly difficult for new learners to find a space where they can practice the language in their everyday life and build a deeper shared understanding of language and culture together. In league with <a href=""https://en.unesco.org/idil2022-2032"">UNESCO's Decade of Indigenous Languages</a> and with our partners in Cherokee communities, we focus on bridging language practice (perseverance) and language documentation (preservation) into language persistence. We build a place where people from all walks of life can come together to speak, listen, read, and write in Cherokee.</p>
<h3>Why DAILP?</h3>
<p>DAILP centers historical documents as part of a vital work of language perseverance. Through detailed translations and linguistic resources, we make these documents accessible for language learning, scholarship, and public history. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use interface that brings together the Cherokee syllabary, English translation, and word-by-word review in ways that support language learners of all levels as they explore these Cherokee writings. We use the Cherokee language resources available to us in print and online modes to further illuminate these historical documents.</p>"

<p>In this and upcoming discussions about Cherokee verbs, read and try to understand the material, but don't worry about trying to take it all in or memorize. You can always refer back later. The most important thing is to just become familiar with how the verbs work.</p>

<p>Cherokee verbs are complicated because they are very specific, and they contain a lot of information.</p>

<p>There are different ways to look at and study Cherokee verbs. Different linguists may use different terms, but, in general, all Cherokee verbs must contain at least these three parts: The <strong>PRONOUN</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PREFIX</strong>, which tells who is doing what, and sometimes, to whom; the <strong>VERB STEM</strong>, which tells what is being done; and the <strong>TENSE SUFFIX</strong>, which tells when the action takes place. The verb stem can be broken down into more parts, but that is not necessary to our introductory remarks here. </p>

<p>The pronoun prefix, which is attached just before the verb stem, tells who is involved in the action of the verb. There are two sets of pronoun prefixes, Set A, which is often used with verbs of action, and Set B, which is usually used with more passive, or static verbs. Although you will hear people talk about Set A and Set B verbs, keep in mind that Set A verbs may take Set B pronoun prefixes in certain circumstances. </p>

<p>Below, you will find a Set A chart, using the sample verbs <em>gawoniha, </em>'he or she is speaking', and <em>ega, </em>'he or she is going.' Following that, is a Set B chart, using the sample verbs, <em>uha</em>, 'He or she has it' (something neutral) and <em>uduliha, </em>'he or she wants it.'</p>

<p>Notice that the prefixes are different according to whether the stem starts with a consonant or a vowel. Notice also, that the second person double (You two), and second person plural (You all), is exactly the same for both  Set A and Set B. They are highlighted in pale green. Once you learn those prefixes, you won't have to worry about whether you need a Set A or Set B prefix since they are identical. </p>

<p><strong>                            </strong><strong>gawoniha</strong>––He or she is speaking /  <strong>ega</strong>––He or she is going  </p>

<p>          Set A prefixes are often used with verbs dealing with actions.<strong>  </strong></p>

<p><strong>MORE ABOUT CHEROKEE VERBS AND PRONOUN PREFIXES </strong></p>

<p>As we have seen, all verbs in Cherokee <em>must include</em> the <strong>PRONOUN</strong><strong> </strong>(or Pronomial)<strong> </strong><strong>PREFIX</strong>. This prefix tells who performs the action of the verb,  referred to as the subject. For example, if you see hiwoniha, ᎯᏬᏂᎭ, <em>hi-</em> is the pronoun prefix and shows that <strong>YOU</strong> are speaking, so <strong>YOU</strong> are the subject.</p>

<p>There are also pronoun prefixes which show not only the verb subject, but also the object, the one to whom the action was done. An example would be, <em>tsiyatvgia</em>, ᏥᏰᏛᎩᎠ, 'I hear him or her.' The prefix <strong>tsiy-</strong> shows that <strong>I</strong> did something to <strong>HIM</strong><strong> </strong>or <strong>HER</strong>.<em> </em>So a single prefix shows immediately how many people are included in the action, and specifies who did something to another, or others.</p>

<p>As we saw in the above chart it can be helpful to use pictures to visualize the prefixes, especially as they get more complicated. You can use similar emojis on your computers and phones.</p>

<p>What this tells us about Cherokee is that the pronoun prefixes paint a picture of everyone involved in the verb's action, and specifies who is doing what, and who is doing what to whom. </p>

<p>In Cherokee, the pronouns immediately picture the people involved.</p>

<p>In English we need a sentence to talk about this picture:</p>

<p> 'He hears it.'</p>

<p>In Cherokee, you just say: ᎠᏛᎩᎠ <em>atvgia</em> 'He hears it.'</p>

<p><strong>VERB STEMS</strong></p>

<p>The verb stem, sometimes called the aspect stem, is not the same as the root, which is part of the stem. You don't need to know the root, and you don't even need to know the word ""stem"" to learn Cherokee, but it's good to be familiar with stems because you will come across the term in other materials. As mentioned before, different linguists and writers may have different ways of dividing up the stem. Below is a simple way of looking at the main parts of the verb:</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-table""><table class=""has-fixed-layout""><tbody><tr><td>Pronounprefix</td><td>Verb Stem</td><td>Tense suffix</td></tr><tr><td>Who is involved in the action of the verb</td><td>The base of the verb to which the prefixes and suffixes are attached. It contains the meaning of the verb, for example, run, walk, want, speak</td><td>When the action of the verb takes place</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Below is the verb <em>tsiwoniha, I am speaking</em>.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-table""><table class=""has-fixed-layout""><tbody><tr><td>PronounPrefix: Who?</td><td>Verb Stem:What?</td><td>Tense Ending:When?</td></tr><tr><td>tsiI</td><td>wonihspeak</td><td>anow</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>You are already familiar with the prefixes and suffixes from previous lessons. It would be easy if the stem was always the same, but for each verb, there are five distinct stems, sometimes called Aspect Stems. Please note again that this is only one way to divide up the verb. Other authors may differ. </p>

<p>The stems are the bases on which different tenses are built. As you can see from the chart below, several tenses may be formed on one stem. The Present Aspect Stem is used for actions which are occuring in the present time. The Immediate Aspect Stem is used for actions that have very recently taken place. It is also used for commands to be acted upon immediately. The Incompletive Aspect Stem is used for actions that have not yet been complete. The Completeive Aspect Stem is used for actions which have been completed in the past, or which will be completed in the future. Finally, the Infinitive Aspect Stem is most often used to express obligation or possibility.</p>

<p>Using what you learned from the exercise above, translate the following into Cherokee:</p>

<p>(Phonetice or syllabary). Review the Days of the Week and use the Set A & B chart to find the correct prefixes if needed.</p>

<p>A sentence might be: I am going to speak tomorrow. / ᏌᎾᎴ ᏓᏥᏬᏂᏏ  </p>

<p>1. I will be speaking on Monday.___________________________________</p>

<p>2. I am going to speak on Friday.__________________________________</p>

<p>3. He will be speaking on Saturday.__________________________________</p>

<p>4. They will be speaking tomorrow.__________________________________</p>

<p>5. Who will be speaking? _________________________________________</p>

<p>5-5</p>

<p><strong>TENSE SUFFIXES</strong></p>

<p>All Cherokee verbs need a tense suffix, to tell when the verb's action takes place. These tense suffixes are attached at the end of the verb stem. However, it's important to understand that there are other suffixes which may be attached to the tense suffix, adding additional meaning. For example, if the suffix –<em>gwu</em>, is attached to the verb, <em>tsiwoniha</em>, I am speaking, the result is <em>tsiwonihagwu</em>, 'I am just speaking,' or 'I am only speaking.' So, when you are looking at a verb and thinking about its tense, remember that the tense suffix doesn't always come last. Here is a list of basic tense endings:</p>

<p>-a, -i  present tense   <em>gawonih</em><strong><em>a </em></strong>  He or she is speaking</p>

<p>                                     <em> aktosd</em><strong><em>i</em></strong><strong> </strong>       He or she is looking at him/it</p>

<p>          recent past      <em>hiwonih</em><strong><em>i </em></strong><strong> </strong>   You spoke, just now, recently</p>

<p>          imperative       <em>hiwonih</em><strong><em>i</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em> </em>   Speak!</p>

<p>-v'i   remote past   <em>uwonis</em><strong><em>v'i</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>   He or she spoke</p>

<p>-v'i   future imperative, imperative, or command, to act in the future</p>

<p>                            <em>hiwonis</em><strong><em>v'i</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>  Speak! (At a later time, not now)</p>

<p>-e'i   non-experienced </p>

<p>          past (the speaker was not there)</p>

<p>                             <em> uwonis</em><strong><em>e'i</em></strong><strong> </strong>   He or she spoke ( I was told)</p>

<p>-esdi  future progressive (ongoing in the future)</p>

<p>                         <em>gawonisg</em><strong><em>esdi</em></strong><em> </em>  He or she will be speaking</p>

<p>-di    infinitive       <em>uwonihis</em><strong><em>di</em></strong>   He or she to speak</p>

<p>-oi    habitual        <em>gawonisg</em><strong><em>o'i</em></strong><em> </em>  He or she always, or usually speaks</p>

<p>-oi    pluperfect</p>

<p>In the following words taken from WILLIE JUMPER MANUSCRIPTS: Story of the Old Man Willie Pigeon, write the tense you think it is, for example, present tense, infinitive, etc. Then look up the words in the story and write the meaning.</p>

<p>Cherokee people have proven themselves to be prolific writers in the language since the early 1820's when a Cherokee man named Sequoyah first introduced the 86-character Cherokee syllabary to his people. A remarkable invention for its time, the Cherokee syllabary was the first writing system ever developed and used by an indigenous nation in the United States. Within five years, Cherokee people practiced widespread reading and writing without print or mass education to facilitate their learning. Today, thousands of documents inked in the Cherokee syllabary can be found in archives around the United States. These documents include letters, teachings, instructions, recollections, social commentaries, stories, histories, lists, church records, and more — the quotidian literacies of Cherokee life.</p>
<p>These documents have served as a dominant cultural expression of the Cherokee people in the United States since the beginning of the twentieth century. Written between 1880 and 1960, these documents include church records, remembrances, speeches, letters, and governance documents. These documents tell the stories of church deacons mustering small armies of diggers to bury the dead, of community members remembering the local townspeople whose lives modeled self-sufficiency and generosity; of passionate speeches to convince men to continue in Cherokee ways despite the ravages of war and the corruption of money; of Cherokee men teaching each other to read and write in Sequoyah's syllabary while incarcerated in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary; and of early drafts of the governance documents for what would later become the federally recognized United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.</p>"

<p>Communication among Cherokees has changed over time. Once, information was passed along orally, and elders shared their knowledge with young people. Sequoyah's alphabet changed all that, and Cherokee people were able to communicate by written word. They could communicate across long distances using letters. They could gather and discuss and write their own laws. They could post notices of importance to the community. And they could record stories that had been passed down orally for countless generations. It is easy to write and send messages by phone today, and some young people may have little experience with letter writing. It may be difficult to appreciate how much a letter from afar meant to someone before there were telephones or even telegraphs. Family members separated by circumstance would find letter writing a life-line to keep them connected. Even though letters may be written more rarely today, most people are still familiar with the basic form of a letter. Think about how you would you begin a letter you were writing to your mother. What would the greeting be, and would you include any other information before the greeting? Next, look at the beginning of the first three <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/dollie-duncan-letters"">DOLLIE DUNCAN LETTERS</a> (<a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd1"">one</a>, <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd2"">two</a>, <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd3"">three</a>). Write the date and the greeting for each letter in syllabary in the spaces below.</p>

<p>1. 2. 3.</p>

<p>Look at the original text of the first Dollie Duncan letter to answer the following:</p>

<p>1. Who is the letter from?</p>

<p>2. Where is the person who is sending the letter writing from?</p>

<p>3. What relationship is Dollie Duncan to the person writing the letter?</p>

<p>Write your answers to the following in the spaces below. 1. How does the writer address his mother in these letters? 2. How is this different from the way you would address a letter? Read the <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd2"">second Dollie Duncan</a> letter using the story section, then answer the following:</p>

<p>1. Who did the actual writing of this letter?</p>

<p>2. Does this explain the way Walter addresses his mother? Write any thoughts below.</p>

<p>ᎣᏏᏲ <em>osiyo</em> and ᏏᏲ <em>siyo</em> are very commonly used as Cherokee greetings, whether in person or in text. But the usage may be relatively recent. Consider this statement by Rev. Samuel Worcester, written around 1836. Worcester, Rev. S.A. ""Notes on The Select Sentences,"" Archaeologia Americana : Transactions and Collections of the American Antiquarian Society : American Antiquarian Society. Internet Archive Web. June 6, 2021</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"">
<p>""Anciently, at common meetings of acquaintances, no salutation was used. When friends met after a separation of considerable time, they expressed their joy by exclaiming, 'We see each other!'""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One possible example of this greeting may be found in New Testament:</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"">
<p><strong>Matthew 26:49</strong> ᎤᎵᏍᏆᏤ ᎥᏍ ᎦᏉᎩ ᎤᏇᏘᎯ, ᏥᎠ ᏧᏩᎳᏫ; ᏙᏥᏱ ᏦᎾᏓᎪᏩᏛ, ᏍᎩᎾᏛᏝ ; ᎠᏴ ᎤᏚᏓᎴᏫ 'And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail master; and kissed him.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will recognize ""Hail,"" as a greeting. The words which translate as ""Hail"" are:</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"">
<p>ᏙᏥᏱ ᏦᎾᏓᎪᏩᏛ <em>tohiyi denadagowatv/denadaquowatv</em> 'In peace we just saw one another.'</p>

<p>Historical manuscripts are a rich source of insight into the cultural legacy of the Cherokee people. They're also a central element of several projects unfolding across the three federally recognized tribes: the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB), the Cherokee Nation (CN), and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI). In one such project, a translation team led by Ernestine Berry, Director of the Keetoowah's John Hair Cultural Resource Center in Tahlequah, OK translated over 100 documents from the Kilpatrick Collection at the Yale University library. With funds from an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant to the John Hair Cultural Center and Museum, her team selected manuscripts demonstrating a range of importance for day-to-day uses of the syllabary for personal, familial, communal, and political purposes. Their museum exhibit of document reproductions and translations sought to represent the kinds of historically significant documents written in the Cherokee syllabary up through the 1970s. Ernestine Berry kindly shared the Keetoowah team's translations with our team, which became the basis of the current collection. Our team is largely guided by their selection of materials to translate–the stories, funeral notices, letters, and governance documents that they consider urgent to annotate and publish. With their translations, <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw/credits"">the DAILP team</a> created a small pilot collection of richly annotated documents as a proof of concept for a reading environment for these translations.</p>

<p>DAILP's online reading environment demonstrates to scholars and language learners, translators, and teachers how indigenous peoples' reading and writing practices can be analyzed and explained with existing descriptive resources to facilitate reading, searching, and understanding the word-for-word and free translations. Language learners and translators who have worked together to create translations of these archival texts can now look up words in our collection of texts, along with word meaning, usage, the social context of the original production, and occurrences across other documents. To accomplish this, we based our design principles on the day-to-day reasons, uses, and desired interface features identified by members of the Cherokee tribal communities, as well as learners, teachers, and scholars interested in the Cherokee language. In particular, we draw on the historically rooted nature of Cherokee literacy practices and place them within ongoing indigenous language reclamation and revitalization efforts.</p>"

<p>Writing the days of the week has been a part of the Cherokee language since not long after Sequoyah invented the syllabary. Noting days of the week, as well as the time of day, conveys important information in letters, notices and official documents. Since there are only seven days to remember, memorizing the words is not really hard. But, if you understand what the words mean and how they have been used over time, you will deepen your understanding of the language and of the Cherokee world. </p>

<p>Here are the words for the days of the week and their meanings:</p>

<p>ᎤᎾ<strong>ᏙᏓᏆᏅᎢ / ᏙᏓᏆᏅᎢ</strong><strong> </strong><strong>  </strong><em>unadodagwohnvi / dodaquohnvi</em>  <strong>Monday </strong>/When they have finished doing something all day</p>

<p><strong>ᏔᎵᏁ  / ᏔᎵᏁ ᎢᎦ</strong><strong>   </strong><em>taline / taline iga</em>  <strong>Tuesday</strong>/ The second day</p>

<p><strong>ᏦᎢᏁ / ᏦᎢᏁ ᎢᎦ</strong><strong>   </strong><em>tsoine / tsoine iga</em><strong>   Wednesday </strong>/The third day</p>

<p><strong>ᏅᎩᏁ / ᏅᎩᏁ ᎢᎦ</strong><strong>   </strong><em>nvgine/ nvgine iga</em> <strong>Thursday</strong> /The fourth day</p>

<p><strong>ᏧᏅᎩᎶᏍᏗ </strong><em>jun(v)gilosdi</em>   <strong>Friday</strong> / They have to wash clothes (flexible items)</p>

<p><strong>ᎤᎾᏙᏓᏆᏩᏕᎾ / ᏙᏓᏆᏩᏕᎾ</strong><strong> </strong><em>unadodagwidena /</em> <em>dodagwidena</em><strong>   Saturday</strong>/The day before they do something all day long</p>

<p><strong>ᎤᎾᏙᏓᏆᏍᎬᎢ  / ᏙᏓᏆᏍᎬᎢ</strong><strong>   </strong><em>unadodagwasgvi / dodagwasgvi</em><strong> </strong><strong>  Sunday </strong>/The day they do something all day long.</p>

<p>Some Cherokees prefer to write Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as ᏔᎵᏁ, 'second,' ᏦᎢᏁ, 'third,' and ᏅᎩᏁ, 'fourth ' without ᎢᎦ <em>iga</em><em>,</em> 'day.' The reasoning is that since ᎢᎦ refers to day and daylight, it does not encompass the entire twenty-four hour period. Therefore, ᏔᎵᏁ ᎢᎦ<strong>  </strong>would refer only to daytime hours on Tuesday. It is possible that the use of ᎢᎦ arose out of a desire by some to make the Cherokee words correspond more closely to English days of the week, which all end in ""day."" </p>

<p>Reading Cherokee is important, and the New Testament is one of the great treasuries of language. Think that when you are reading these words, you are reading as people spoke in the 1800s. Here, I found some of the words we have been studying.</p>

<p>Vocabulary</p>

<p>ᎾᏍᎩ <em>nasgi</em>  that, that one</p>

<p>ᎨᏎᎢ<em> </em><em>gesei</em>  it was</p>

<p>Ꮓ   <em>-hno</em> added to the and of the word, can mean ""and""</p>

<p>From the New Testament:</p>

<p><em>Tsalagi Itse Kanohedv Datlohidv Tsutsosawati Tsalagi Ale Yonega = The Cherokee New Testament, Parallel Cherokee & English: Translation Based upon the Received Text</em>. Global Bible Society, 2015.</p>

<p>The Cherokee New Testament can also be found online:</p>

<p><em>Cherokee English Dictionary</em>, www.cherokeedictionary.net/cnt/ </p>

<p><strong>Mark 1:21</strong></p>

<p>ᎤᎾᏙᏓᏆᏍᎬ ᎢᎦ   <em>unadodagwasgv iga</em></p>

<p>'the sabbath day'</p>

<p><strong>Mark 15:42</strong> </p>

<p>ᎾᏍᎩ ᎤᎾᏙᏓᏆᏩᏕᎾ ᎢᎦ ᎨᏎᎢ <em>nasgi unadodgwidena iga gesei</em></p>

<p>'that is, the day before the sabbath'</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 28:1</strong></p>

<p>ᎤᎾᏙᏓᏆᏅᎲᏃ <em> unadodagwohnvhihno</em></p>

<p>'And in the end of the sabbath'</p>

<p>Practice reading the above sentences aloud.</p>

<p><em>Unadodagwasgvi</em>, Sunday, is usually said to mean: the day they are doing things all day. In the New Testament <em>unadodagwasgvi </em>is used for the Sabbath. You might want to think about why that is. You can write something about it if you like, or just mull it over when you have a chance.</p>

<p>Write the words for Saturday, Sunday and Monday in phonetics below:</p>

<p><strong>DICTIONARY STUDY</strong> </p>

<p>For the next section you will need to use Durbin Feeling's Dictionary. </p>

<p>Feeling, Durbin. <em>Cherokee-English Dictionary</em>. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 1975.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-image is-resized""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf3mcecizSK_IYvgu9CrpwtPE64s3ntfhjxwD3M4cPINiVaCld0e6E4xvAhuutGZ-MKLFwC5f_m2sHljdLBRdobqsyxYVBukJzwtLT17PBhZMUU2kxEI_tMhLQjKTO9eA0apT8e9I84728noxAvmoL8T9YoSIW8uhVKkn0ky8RNrMNDrCeF8ps?key=x1EG3E0ekfUq3h1ynZDIdQ"" alt=""/Users/maryrae/Desktop/Screen Shot 2020-01-06 at 5.12.51 PM.png"" style=""width:365px;height:auto""/></figure>

<p>If you don't have a copy, you can find an online version here:</p>

<p>http://www.cherokeedictionary.net/</p>

<p>Below is a highly simplified guide for beginning to familiarize yourself with the entries you will find in the dictionary. The first thing to remember is that verbs will always be listed under the <strong>third person singular </strong>(he, she or it), <strong>present tense</strong> form. So if you want to know about the word <em>to want, </em> you will look it up in the English-Cherokee portion in the back of the dictionary, or type in 'want' in the online dictionary, and you will get a listing for <em>uduliha</em>, 'he or she wants it.' In Durbin Feeling's dictionary, it is on page 163, and looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>Third person singular</strong></p>

<p>ᎤᏚᎵᎭ<br><em>uduliha</em>      'he (or she) wants it'</p>

<p>Below the main entry (or across from it in the online dictionary), you will usually see five sub-entries, and they will be in the same order for every verb.</p>

<p>1. <strong>First person singular, present tense:</strong> </p>

<p>   ᎠᏆᏚᎵᎭ<br>  <em> </em><em>agwaduliha</em> 'I want it'</p>

<p>2. <strong>Third person singular, non-progressive, remote past tense:</strong></p>

<p>   ᎤᏚᎸᎲᎢ<br>  <em>udulvhvi</em>  'He or she wanted it'</p>

<p>3. <strong>Third person singular present habitual:</strong></p>

<p>   ᎤᏚᎵᏍᎪᎢ<br>  <em>udulisgoi</em>  'He, or she always or usually wants it'</p>

<p>4. <strong>Imperative 2nd person command form:</strong></p>

<p>   ᏯᏚᎳ<br>  <em>jadula</em>'Want it!' (You)</p>

<p>5. <strong>Third person singular infinitive:</strong></p>

<p>   ᎤᏚᎸᏗ<br>  <em>uduhldi </em> 'He or she to want it,' (similar to our infinitive, ""to want""), or 'he or she has to want it.'</p>

<p>Notice that every entry is written in syllabary, phonetic, and then phonetic with markings as a guide to pronunciation. You will find more information about pronunciation in Durbin Feeling's dictionary.</p>

<p>The dictionary entries are followed by at least one sentence, using one of the forms of the verb just given.</p>

<p>ᎤᏓᏪᎶᏍᏙᏗ ᎤᏚᎵᎭ.<br><em>Udawesolvsdohdi </em><em>uduliha</em><em>.</em><br><em>He wants</em><em> to rest.</em></p>

<p>The word in the entry is underlined, in both the Cherokee and English, in this case <em>uduliha</em>, <em>He wants</em>. The meaning of the sentence is given as, He wants to rest, but it could also be she wants to rest.</p>

<p><em>Udawesolvsdohdi</em> is the <strong>infinitive form</strong> of the verb found in the dictionary as: adawesolvsdiha, he's resting.  By itself, it can mean <em>He or she has to rest</em>, or <em>He or she is supposed to rest</em>. These meanings can apply to all infinitives. </p>

<p>As you can see from the sample sentence, if you combine a present verb like udliha with the infinite like Udawesolvsdohdi, he to rest, you can make a sentence with the meaning, he or she wants to rest: <em>Udawesolvsdohdi uduliha.</em></p>

<p>______________________</p>

<p>Another interesting day of the week word is ᏧᏅᎩᎶᏍᏗ, Friday, which means <em>the day when they have to wash clothes</em> (flexible items).</p>

<p>KEY</p>

<p>2-5</p>

<p>1. Is there anything in the entry similar to ᏧᏅᎩᎶᏍᏗ ? </p>

<p> If you start with the english and look up washing, the drop down menu will show the verb <em>dekgiloa</em>, 'he's washing flexible objects,' (including clothes) Under 3rd infinitive you   will see <em>juhgilosdi(</em>also<em> junhgilosdi)</em>. That would mean 'he or she to wash them' (flexible), or </p>

<p>     '<em>he or she has to wash them</em>.'  Notice it is third person singular.</p>

<p>2. How can we tell from the verb that they are not washing dishes?</p>

<p>The definition includes<em> '</em>washing flexible objects (including clothes),' so it could not be used with  something like dishes. This is a classificatory verb which tells you, even without mention of the actual object being spoken of, what sort of object it is. The five   classifications are : Solid /Liquid / Living / Flexible /Long and Slender.</p>

<p>3.  How can we tell it is <em>they </em>and not <em>he</em> , <em>she</em> or <em>you</em>? </p>

<p>   You have already seen the 3rd person singular form, <em>junhgilosdi</em>. /-un- indicates plural.   </p>

<p>4. How could we say, <em>He has to wash clothes</em>?</p>

<p>   <em> </em><em>Juhgilosdi</em>.  You might try out fuller sentences such as: <em>Tsani dihnawo jugilosdi adiha</em>. 'Johnny has to wash clothes, he is saying.'  </p>

<p>The following collection of funeral notices offers a unique window into the nature of both grief and belonging in the Giduwa community. Giduwa people's deep ethos of communitarian values meant that each notification of an individual's loss hurt the community as a whole. At the same time, the notices made a specific action request of community members that appears unique in the context of contemporary American culture: they implored friends and neighbors to come and dig the graves. Through announcing a collective loss and calling the community to action, the notices reified the community for what it was – a collective of individuals who would work for each other's wellbeing and band together in times of loss and grief.</p>
<p>This work ethos reflects a deep adherence to an ancient community value. The concept of ᎦᏉᏙ (<i>gadugi</i>), which translates to ""community to go out as is custom,"" refers to the idea of cooperative labor and the belief that people will come together to help each other when the need arises. At the time of these notices, the concept of the ᎦᏉᏙ encompassed all members of the ᏚᎦᏉᏙ (<i>sgadugi</i>) – the town or community. Community was not something metaphorical or abstract, but an indicator of responsibility for direct action in supporting one's neighbors.</p>
<p>Even in the midst of community members' grief, strong bonds of mutual aid united Giduwa people. The notices here provide a valuable glimpse into the social and cultural norms of the time, calling us to reflect on the nature of community in our own lives. How does mutual support factor in as a quality of the community in which we live? For many of our ancestors, it reflected a willingness to enact community through concrete, embodied action. In the darkest of circumstances, Giduwa people showed love through action.</p>"

<p>In Module One, we saw how Cherokees worked together to learn the syllabary in the early 1800s. They demonstrated the idea of ᎦᏚᎩ <em>gadugi, </em>which can be defined as working together towards a common goal.</p>

<p>In <em>The Shadow of Sequoyah, </em>Anna Gritts Kilpatrick writes of Oklahoma Cherokees:</p>

<p>""…the gadugi is composed of unpaid workers called together for a specific task in the interests of a private charity or community welfare.""</p>

<p>Kilpatrick, Anna Gritts. <em>The Shadow of Sequoyah</em>. Univ. of Oklahoma Press,1965, p. 75.</p>

<p><em>Gadugi</em> is so much a part of Cherokee life that the word for <em>state </em>is very similar, ᏍᎦᏚᎩ <em>sgadugi.</em> </p>

<p>""The word for <em>state</em> draws upon the word ᎦᏚᎩ<em>gadugi, </em>which refers to organized teams of people working collectively for a commonly shared goal…While the English word <em>state </em>describes a political organization that grew from regionalism, the Cherokee word more closely matches a historical tradition of collective action.""</p>

<p>Cushman, Ellen. <em>Cherokee Syllabary: Writing the People's Perseverance</em>. Univ Of Oklahoma Press, 2013, p.197.  <em>Gadugi</em> can take many forms. Think about how the following examples demonstrate <em>gadugi</em>.</p>

<p>  1. Dollie Duncan letters were sent from a young man in prison, Walter Duncan, to his mother. Apparently, he was learning to write in syllabary, but had the help friends in the meantime. At the end of the second letter we read that Alsdawadi has been writing on Walter Duncan's behalf :</p>

<p><strong>ᎠᎵᏍᏓᏩᏗ ᏃᎸᏏ ᎪᏪᎸᎦ</strong><br><em>alsdawadi        nokwsi          gowelvga</em><br>Alsdawadi        Nokwsi         I wrote this</p>

<p>I wrote this. A-li-s-da-wa-di No-k-si</p>

<p>Alsdawadi has been helping Walter. Even in prison, Cherokees practiced <em>gadugi</em>, helping one another to accomplish a goal, in this case, to write a letter.</p>

<p>2. The ECHOTA FUNERAL NOTICES are an especially poignant example of <em>gadugi</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Funeral Notice for Vwodi Aditasgi</em>, we read:</p>

<p><strong>ᏂᎦᏗᎰᏃ   ᎡᏍᎦᏂ ᎢᏥᎷᏥ ᎠᎴ ᎢᏣᏍᎪᎵ ᎦᏙᎯ   ᎢᎦᎵᎢ</strong><br><em>nigadihno  esgahni   ijiluji   ale      ijasgoli    gadohi     our friends</em><br>All local residents come and dig the grave, Friends, come.</p>

<p>In ""Funeral Notice for Gvsgalisgi Wahya,"" we read:</p>

<p><strong>ᎠᎴ ᏧᎾᏁᎶᏗ ᎢᏣᏓᏢᎬᎢ ᏗᏥᎸᏫᏍᏓᏁᎯ ᏗᏓᏂᏐᏗᎯ  ᎠᏍᎪᏍᏗ ᏂᎦᎵᏍᏗᏗ</strong><br><em>ale   junanelhdi    ijadatlvgvi   dijilvhwista'nehi   didanisodihi   asgosdi     nigalisdidi</em><br>It becomes necessary for you workers in the Sunday School and Church organizations to dig a grave. </p>

<p>3. In the Governance Documents, we find the following in ""Cherokee Republican Consitution:""</p>

<p><strong>ᏂᎪᎯᎸᎢ ᎠᎵᏂᎬᏁᏗᏱ ᎠᏍᏕᎸᏗᎢ ᎣᎦᎴᎰᎹ ᎠᏁᏂ ᎠᏂᏴᏫᏯ</strong><br><em>nigohilv   alinigvnediyi   asdelvdi'i     ogalehoma  anehv   aniyvwiya</em><br>Further, we shall strive to better serve and help our fellow Oklahoma Indians</p>

<p><strong>SYLLABARY STUDY </strong></p>

<p>We have seen that Cherokee words can have an intrusive h, an air sound that is not represented by a syllabary character. Studying with speakers when possible, and listening to recordings can help students understand where an intrusive h is used. Most students know also that speakers often drop the final vowel sounds when speaking at a natural, conversational speed. In addition,</p>

<p>vowel sounds may be dropped within a word. For example, in the word ᎤᏅᏥ <em>unvtsi</em> 'snow,' the -v- sound is devoiced, and the word sounds like <em>untsi</em>. There is nothing to indicate a dropped or devoiced vowel, so, again, it is important to listen to speakers.</p>

<p>In the GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS: Keetoowah Society Notes, read the first line and write the following, in syllabary, phonetic and English:</p>

<p>1. A word with a dropped vowel</p>

<p>   ___________________________________________________</p>

<p>   ___________________________________________________</p>

<p>   ___________________________________________________</p>

<p>1. A word with an intrusive h</p>

<p>   ___________________________________________________</p>

<p>   ___________________________________________________</p>

<p>   ___________________________________________________</p>

<p>   Syllabary charts do not often show all the possible sounds for syllabary characters. While it is not possible to indicate dropped vowels, intusive h can be shown in phonetics. In the chart below, circle the syllabary characters  with the dropped vowel and intrusive h that you found in the Keetoowah Society Notes.</p>

However, have you ever thought of what the word <i>osiyo</i> really means? The late Cherokee linguist Durbin Feeling used to say, <em>Gado usdi idadiha?</em> ‘What are we saying?’, urging us to think about the true Cherokee thought behind the word and not just its English translation.</p><p>If we look at the morphemic breakdown of the word, we get a more accurate understanding of how this word functions. The root word <i>osi</i> comes from the word meaning ‘well, good.’ The particle –<i>yo</i> (sometimes –<i>yu</i>) is attached to the end of some words/verbs to give an emphatic meaning. Before this word became commonly used as a greeting, it was used in many written documents at the end of the speaker’s message to convey a meaning of sincerity. The word is more accurately translated as, ‘it is good.’</p><p>Let’s look at some other examples used for greeting one another that are found throughout the corpus of the DAILP database.</p><p><b>ᏙᎯᏧ <em>tohitsu</em> ᎣᏏᏧ <em>ositsu</em> ‘How are you?’</b></p><p>The root word <b><i>tohi</i></b> refers to ‘peace’ or ‘balance.’</p><p>The word <b><i>osi</i></b> also translates to ‘well, alright, fine.’</p><p>The suffix <b>–</b><b><i>tsu</i></b> makes the word or phrase a question.</p><p><b>Ꭷ </b><b><i>ka </i></b><b>Now!</b> let’s look at some other common greetings and responses that may be used in a typical Cherokee conversation.</p><ol><li><em>osiquu</em> ‘[I’m] just fine.’<ol><li>The root word <i>osi</i> is translated to mean ‘good, well.’</li></ol></li><li><em>tohiquu</em> ‘[I’m] just fine.’<ol><li>The word <i>tohi</i> refers to being at peace or feeling a sense of balance.</li><li>The suffix –<i>quu</i> is attached to words and verbs to mean ‘just, only.’</li></ol></li><li><em>tohiquu</em>dv, <em>osiquudv</em> ‘[I’m] just fine.’<ol><li><em>tohi</em>: ‘peace, balance’</li><li><em>-quu</em>: suffix meaning ‘just, only’</li><li><em>-dv</em>: suffix giving emphasis to a certain word or statement; in this case, affirming that someone is doing well</li></ol></li><li><i>osiquuju</i><i> </i>‘Are you well?’<ol><li><em>-ju</em>: question suffix</li></ol></li><li><em>tohiquuju</em>, <em>osiquutsu</em> ‘How are you?’<ol><li><em>osi</em>: ‘good, well’</li><li><em>tohi</em>: ‘peace, balance’</li><li><em>-quu</em>: suffix meaning ‘just, only’</li><li><em>-tsu</em>: question suffix</li></ol></li><li><em>osiquus</em>, <em>tohiquus </em>‘How are you?’<ol><li><em>osi</em>: ‘good, well’</li><li><em>tohi</em>: ‘peace, balance’</li><li><em>-quu</em>: suffix meaning ‘just, only’</li><li><em>-s</em>: question suffix</li></ol></li><li><em>nihina</em> ‘How about you?’<ol><li>This word is broken down into two morphemes (word parts).

<p>Perhaps the most intimate genre of writing, letters enact relationship between the writer and the recipient. As such, the letters in the Dollie Duncan and the Yale Beinecke collections offer innermost access to conversations between two parties intending to stay close across distance. This basic scenario, evidenced across a range of specific situations, highlights the historical and cultural realities Cherokees faced from the late 1860s through the early 1950s – from mid-century to mid-century. Apparent also in the letters are the ways in which the use of written Cherokee language increased in the decades following forced removal, both because of it and as a way to mitigate its exponential impacts – the separation of family members, the reorganization of communities, the strain of generational poverty, and the loss of political sovereignty, as examples.</p>
<p>Yet the relationships sustained within these letters demonstrate the persistence of Keetoowah values and lifeways despite increasing constraints. The individual and cultural adaptations revealed within them become more remarkable in the context of advancing federal treaties and incursive legislation executed from the end of the Civil War, through the destruction of tribal governments during the allotment period, and into the first half of the 20th century as U.S. assimilation policies intensified. Contextualized within intentionally rapid and violent cultural genocide, the quality of relatedness upheld and practiced by Cherokee people well prior to colonial contact and exhibited still within these letters continued to safeguard them, as well as the culture, and ultimately protected the nation.</p>
<p>From the multiple voices represented across these collections emerges one voice, unified by a Keetoowah ethic: encourage, strengthen, and help one another, working together so that all rise. The details of everyday lives and intonations of loving connections express the tender enduring heart of a people committed to each other against all odds. These relationships written into syllabary script convey the human spirit and relentless will of a nation refusing to be divided.</p>"

<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">Whenever Cherokee speakers get together, they are always laughing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common sentiment expressed by folks who speak and/or understand &#x13e3;&#x13b3;&#x13a9; <i>tsalagi</i> &lsquo;Cherokee&rsquo;. Humor is such an important aspect in any language and is transmitted in so many ways that it is impossible to understand the breadth of a people&rsquo;s worldview until you are able to understand their humor. Laughter is often the best medicine and the way that we can gauge how comfortable we are with each other in a social setting. Below are some examples that we find in the texts across the DAILP collections that show us real examples of the humor of Cherokee people in their own words.</p>
<p><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd1""><b>&#x13a0;&#x13f4; &#x13a8;&#x13d2; &#x13a5;&#x13dd; &#x13a0;&#x13cf; &#x13f1;&#x13ac;&#x13a9;&#x13ad; &#x13da;&#x13ef;</b></a></p>
<p><em><b>Ayv gesv vtla asi yigvgiha tuya</b></em></p>
<p>Me &ndash; as for &ndash; not &ndash; yet &ndash; they are [not] killing me &ndash; beans</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for me, the beans have not killed me yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I find this example above to be especially humorous because the verb &ldquo;they are killing me,&rdquo; takes on the animate form so as to paint the picture that the beans are life-like and are killing the speaker in a figurative way. Examples such as this one are only one of many that you&rsquo;ll find when learning Cherokee and listening to Cherokee speakers. This is the precise reason why there is never more than a few moments in between laughter when Cherokee speakers get together.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ok then, now there is the smell of the beans [in the air]. I guess now, our jaws will be flapping again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the word &#x13d9;&#x13d9;&#x13a3;&#x13a9;&#x13c6;&#x13c3;&#x13f4;&#x13b5;&#x13cf;. Depending on how the person who is reading this interprets the word, it could mean one of two things. If pronounced <i>dogikwanohyvlsi</i>, it would mean &lsquo;our cheeks made noise.&rsquo; If pronounced with one slight sound change, <i>dogiquanohyvlsi</i> would denote the meaning of &lsquo;our butt cheeks made noise.&rsquo; One slight sound change can result in an immediate uproar of laughter and possibly falling off one&rsquo;s chair in amusement.</p>
<p><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd9""><b>&#x13a0;&#x13f4;&#x13c3; &#x13be; &#x13a3;&#x13a9;&#x13c1;&#x13ab;&#x13e5;&#x13d3; &#x13a8;&#x13d2; &#x13be;&#x13cd;&#x13cb; &#x13d9;&#x13af;&#x13cb; &#x13d9;&#x13a9;&#x13c6;&#x13c3;&#x13f4;&#x13b5; &#x13af;&#x13a0; &#x13a4;&#x13d2; &#x13a1;&#x13af; &#x13a3;&#x13a8;&#x13b3;&#x13cd;&#x13d3;</b></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Ayvhno na oginegutsida gesv nasquv tohiquv dogikwanoyvli hi&rsquo;a usv ogelasda</em></strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;As for us mean ones, we were noisy during dinner this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The word &#x13a3;&#x13a9;&#x13c1;&#x13ab;&#x13e5;&#x13d3; <em>oginegutsida</em> can mean either &lsquo;us mean ones&rsquo; or &lsquo;us mischievous ones,&rsquo; it just depends on the context of the sentence. The verb <em>dogiquanoyvli</em> again, is talking about &lsquo;sound coming from our hips or buttocks.&rsquo; So, they are calling themselves &lsquo;mean ones&rsquo; for how the beans made them react.</p>

<h1>ᎬᎲᎨᏒ ᎢᎯᏫᏑᏟ – Introduction</h1>
<p><i>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</i> provides a critical backstory to the dark times in Cherokee history during the decades following the Dawes General Allotment Act (1889) and the Curtis Act (1898), a policy that Teddy Roosevelt venerated as a ""mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass."" These federal policies dismantled tribal governments and divided the collectively held lands of indigenous peoples into individual parcels to instill in them a sense of ""selfishness, which is at the bottom of civilization"" (Dawes). These devastating policies created economic and social disasters exacerbated by deaths from the Spanish flu, the abject poverty of the Great Depression, the environmental disaster of the Dust Bowl, and the population exodus to cities after World War II. This history contours these writings and foregrounds their significance; the Cherokee people used these writings as a means to organize themselves and to sustain their sense of collective purpose.</p>
<p>These documents also reveal how even the most common of literate acts helps to propel a people forward toward a shared future of peace, health, security, and self-governance. These translations offer insight into the day-to-day community-building work of Cherokee language and literacy at the heart of Cherokee ᏚᎶᏉᏙ, communities, towns, and governance structures. Within these translations, readers will find parallels to our times and will draw lessons that speak to not only the best of Cherokee civic spirit, but the best of the human civic spirit. Needless to say, the lessons these documents hold could not be more apt, timely and needed. Cherokee language learners and teachers will find materials and resources to support their continued practice of the Cherokee language.</p>"

<p>In the pages collected here, the skill of Cherokee families, work teams, church congregations, and communities to collectively organize themselves to maintain Cherokee civic life. The social compact demonstrated in these documents is even more compelling when seen in the context of assimilation policies bent on instilling rugged individualism.</p>
<p>But these documents provide more than just moving accounts of how Cherokees banded together to bury their dead, remember their civic leaders, govern themselves, educate each other, and form a new government. These documents also reveal the very concrete ways that even the most common of literate acts helps to propel people forward toward a shared future of peace, health, security, and self-governance.</p>
<p>In one Willie Jumper story, we learn of Decoration Day, held at the end of May at the Barber Cemetery. In this annual event, elders and families chose a singer to lead their procession around the cemetery singing songs in memory of their dead ancestors. Families then would decorate the graves of their loved ones. Documenting these practices illustrate individuals' perseverance and a people's collective resilience — particularly while enduring failed federal government policies, the disintegration of local governance structures, a global pandemic, and an environmental disaster.</p>"

<p>The intricacies of metaphor can be seen woven throughout the Cherokee language. Cherokee, being a verb based language, is filled with what in English would be called &ldquo;metaphor.&rdquo; However, in Cherokee, metaphor is simply built into the structure of the way people naturally speak. The beauty is in the morphemes that come together to create a vast image of action. Below are some examples of metaphor found throughout various texts written in Cherokee and others are from speakers themselves.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>&#x13a0;&#x13c6;&#x13d3;&#x13c5;&#x13d9; &#x13ad;&#x13eb;&#x13c2; &#x13e5;&#x13d0;&#x13c5;&#x13ef;&#x13cd;&#x13aa;&#x13a2;.</b>
<ol>
<li><i>aquadando hawini tsisonvysgo&rsquo;i</i></li>
<li>&lsquo;I pour my heart [emotions] out.&rsquo;</li>
<li>The act of pouring your soul out is not physically possible so that&rsquo;s why this is a great example of metaphor within Cherokee. The verb &#x13e5;&#x13d0;&#x13c5;&#x13ef;&#x13cd;&#x13aa;&#x13a2; <i>tsisonvysgo&rsquo;i </i>is also interesting here because the use of it is in reference to pouring something out that is liquid.</li>

<p>&#x13e8;&#x13d4;&#x13d7;&#x13ad; <i>tsvtadiha </i>is a form of one of the most common verbs in Cherokee:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x13a0;&#x13d7;&#x13ad;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>adiha </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;he/she/it is saying&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The present tense stem of &#x13a0;&#x13d7;&#x13ad; <i>adiha </i>is /-<i>adih</i>-/. Most resource materials, however, do not use the stem to identify verbs. Verb stems, detached from their pronoun prefixes and tense indicators never occur in the language. For this reason, while a verb stem seen by itself is useful in teaching materials, it has no meaning on its own.</p>
<p>Instead, the third person singular form (he/she/it) of the present tense is used as the dictionary entry form of the Cherokee verb. The present progressive (-<em>ing</em> form, ongoing in the present) of the English verb is usually used to translate the Cherokee present tense, which is used specifically to tell what is happening right now.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of &#x13a0;&#x13d7;&#x13ad; <i>adiha</i> in the present tense. Notice that the verb always appears &lsquo;fully outfitted&rsquo; with prefixes to indicate, among other things, the subject of the verb, and a suffix to indicate the ongoing present tense:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x13e8;&#x13d4;&#x13d7;&#x13ad;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tsvtadiha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;as you are saying&rsquo; (Letters to Duncan: <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd6/"">1951-02-07</a> and <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd9/"">1951-04-04</a>)</p>

<p>Notice how all the forms end in &ndash;<i>a</i>, the most common present tense ending in Cherokee. Cherokee uses the present tense to talk about experiences and actions happening right now.</p>

<p>The pronoun prefixes for 3rd person singular Set A verbs can vary a lot from verb to verb, as you can see. The first set of three prefixes in parentheses (<em>a</em>-, <em>ga</em>-, <em>ka</em>-) appear on verb stems that begin with a consonant. When the verb begins with a vowel, the 3rd person singular may take a <i>g-</i> prefix, or no prefix at all, like the verb we will look at now.</p>

<p>Following a pattern among many Cherokee verbs that have an <i>h</i> sound in the stem, the first person singular <i>gadi&rsquo;a</i> drops the <i>h</i> sound and replaces it with a **glottal stop**, indicated with an apostrophe.</p>
<p>Cherokee does not have separate pronoun prefixes for &lsquo;he,&rsquo; &lsquo;she,&rsquo; or &lsquo;it.&rsquo; The gender of the person doing the action depends on context.</p>
<p>Fun fact! Cherokee distinguishes between forms of &lsquo;we&rsquo; depending on whether the person being spoken to is **included** or **excluded**. See further discussion below.</p>

<h3>Notes on Pronunciation</h3>
</td>
<td>The <b>glottal stop</b> is one feature of Cherokee pronunciation that requires practice. It is a catch in the voice, like what we hear in the English word &ldquo;reentry&rdquo; just before the second syllable. Sometimes the glottal stop in phonetic transcription is represented with a colon [:], sometimes with the international phonetic symbol [&#x0294;], but here, we will use the apostrophe [&lsquo;].</p>
<p>&#x13a6;&#x13d7;&#x13a0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>gadi&rsquo;a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am saying&rsquo;</p>

<p>Notice that glottal stops are not indicated in the syllabary. The correct pronunciation of each word needs to be learned individually.</td>

<h3>Pronunciation: Tones and Syllable Length</h3>
</td>
<td>Tones and cadence (the pace of pronouncing each syllable in a word) are critical for Cherokee pronunciation. As you learn each new word in Cherokee, it is important to try to imitate as closely as possible the pronunciation of first language speakers, as it will determine whether or not what you are saying will be understood!</p>
<p>There are four basic tones in Cherokee and three gliding tones. Many sources use a method of indicating a word&rsquo;s critical tones using numbers in superscript:</p>
<p>1-lowfall&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3-high&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;23-rising&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;43-high fall</p>
<p>2-neutral&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4-highrise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;32-falling</p>
<p>Syllables will either be short or long, long syllables extending twice the amount of time as short syllables. A short syllable in many sources is indicated with an underdot. Here are two examples of words in syllabary with different meanings depending on pronunciation:</p>
<p>&#x13a0;&#x13b9;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a<sup>3</sup>ma&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;salt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x13a0;&#x13da;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ga<sup>4</sup>du&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bread</p>
<p>&#x13a0;&#x13b9;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a<sup>2</sup>ma&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;water&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x13a0;&#x13da;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ga<sup>2</sup>du<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on top of</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt&rdquo; is pronounced with the first syllable being long and high. &ldquo;Water&rdquo; is pronounced with the first syllable short and neutral. &ldquo;Bread&rdquo; is spoken with a long, highrise first syllable, while &ldquo;on top&rdquo; is pronounced with a short, neutral first syllable and high, long final syllable.</p>
<p>It may seem overwhelming to a new student of Cherokee, but it is not necessary to memorize the tone markers for each word. Simply listen closely and repeat as faithfully as you can to what you hear. Eventually you will begin to recognize patterns as you become more and more familiar with the sounds of the language.</td>

<p>The following collection of governance documents offers a unique insight into the complexities of cultural identity and adaptation among Giduwa (Cherokee) people. These documents were created at a time when the Giduwa community was seeking ways to make themselves legible and understood by outsiders while simultaneously remaining true to themselves and their ancient traditions. Even the spelling of their name – whether Keetoowah, Giduwa, or Cherokee – reflects this tumultuous period of negotiation. The creation of a U.S-style governance structure represented a precarious balance, serving as both an unconventional container for Giduwa ways of being as well as a bridge for communicating with large external institutions. In order to have a voice in government policy decisions that affected their community, they had to represent themselves within a similar constitutional structure, but they had to do so without sacrificing the very nature of who they were.</p>
<p>At the same time, the development of these governance documents reflects a deeper internal process of re-examination and re-negotiation of traditional social mores and institutions. Drafting such documents meant that Giduwas had to adapt to a more centralized, hierarchical way of administration that was not traditionally a part of their culture while thinking carefully about which aspects of the culture they would enshrine within that framework.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the community sought to balance the way they were perceived with the way they truly were. We see them here asking themselves if they should use the language of the documents to describe themselves as accurately as possible, or yield to governmental structures and bureaucracy that did not support their integrity. They were forced to ask themselves if could they show up in a way the United States and its government agencies could comprehend, but maintain their sense of themselves. Their solution to adopt certain structures while operating and interpreting them to maintain Giduwa values reflects a deep resiliency and ingenuity within the community.</p>
<p>This process of negotiation and adaptation linked Giduwa people with many other nations who contended with similar circumstances, reconciling central concepts of cultural integrity with an ability to grow and change. By and large, the struggle of such communities reflects the will of Indigenous people to survive in the face of overwhelming odds. Such struggles also represent the particular resilience of Giduwa people in their willingness to adapt and change to communicate with external powers while remaining true to the core of their identity.</p>"

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These speeches offer a glimpse into the richness and breadth of Cherokee oratory. They show a striving for cohesion in the Giduwa community and maintenance of cultural and spiritual traditions. The speeches range from warnings about cultural trends endangering the community to memories of spirit journeys and histories of how communities were named. Elders gathered to tell stories to younger generations and teach them Giduwa lifeways. Close friends reference and characterize prominent figures as the speeches reveal the inner workings of Giduwa people's souls.<br />

<p>To respect the power their stories hold, Cherokee people regard words themselves as the medicine that makes the world. Breath expelled from our bodies animates the words we speak into the air. These words reflect what we carry inside of us and replicate it outside. Words shape perceptions, influencing our thoughts and the thoughts of others, the choices we make, and the actions we take to construct the reality around us. Words matter. It is our responsibility to use them wisely, knowing we inhale back into our bodies the same air into which we speak.</p>
<p>Stories contain the substance and sustenance of Cherokee life. This collection asserts the strength of the oral tradition through which Keetoowah ways endured, the foundation upon which they continue to rely even as these stories now reside in a digital archive. Before being transcribed into the syllabary, stories persisted for centuries via memory and the spoken word. This practice and its success defy the Western literacy standards imposed during colonization, those that privilege text, print, now pixels, and the complex technologies that produce them with the goal of housing knowledge beyond the body and separating us from who we are. Cherokees have remained resilient through, with, and because of these stories.</p>
<p>The stories herein acknowledge the story's teller and end with a gentle, encouraging command to remember them and share them. Cherokees share stories at the right time with the right people for the right reasons. Often a story appears wanting to be told in a particular situation and for a particular listener or listeners who might benefit. Storytellers rarely explain why a story is told, leaving that work respectfully to the story and the audience. The responsible recipient begins a relationship with the story, one that deepens over time. The story pulses within as its meaning arises, surfacing again in new contexts and ever-changing. Carried upon breath, it passes again to another, always with tribute to the source from whom it was received.</p>
<p>The Willie Jumper Stories permit a pristine encounter with story as the vital center of Cherokee identity. Spanning four decades before and after the 20th century's turn, these accounts depict individual lives and bestow traditional knowledge, blending them together and keeping both people and traditions alive. Elders, relatives, friends, places and communities, beliefs and practices move within these stories as one, illustrating the profound coherence Cherokee cultural integrity entails. Storytelling remembers the past in the present, advancing it for the future. Memory is a vessel and sharing is a sacred obligation.</p>"

<h1 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Introduction</h1>

<p class=""has-text-align-left"">Learning to read and write syllabary is part of becoming well-rounded in the Cherokee language. It also opens the door to understanding old documents, and is thus a window into the past. Every document here is a treasury of Cherokee words and their usage as well as culture. Being able to read and interpret documents is crucial to the survival of the language.</p>

<p>When doing the exercises, also write them out by hand. Typing in syllabary is fun and a great way to use Cherokee across social media. It's also important to be comfortable with typing up documents or lessons to share. But writing Cherokee words by hand is one of the best ways to help you learn and retain them. Researchers have found that writing by hand uses several different parts of the brain together, which helps to cement new material in your memory. When you write, you feel the paper, you feel the pen or pencil, and you call up the shape of the syllabary character from memory, or use a chart to follow. Your mind directs your hand and your fingers to create the shape.<br><br>You are involved directly, and your writing is personal and unique to you. When you type a syllabary character, on the other hand, all you have to do is recognize the correct key and press it. The image is made without any involvement or thought. Anyone could press the same key and make the identical character show up on the screen or paper. It is completely impersonal, and much less likely to be retained in your memory.</p>

<p>Don't rush, but instead write the words out carefully and keep them in a notebook or portfolio for future reference. You will be improving your syllabary and vocabulary at the same time.</p>

<h1 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Recognizing Intrusive H</h1>

<p>Walter Duncan, an inmate at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, sent<br><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/documents/dd1"">a letter on March 11, 1951</a> to his mother, Dollie Duncan.<br>Open the Story view, and read the first line:</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"">
<p>ᎠᏅᏱ ᏜᏉᎿᏁᎢ 195 ᏜᎻᎢ March 11, 1951</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the very first word ᎠᏅᏱ, how would you expect it to be spelled phonetically?<br>Write out the word in syllabary with the phonetics below.<br>For example, the word ᎣᏍᏓ would be written like this:</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"">
<p>ᎣᏍᏓ <em>osda</em> 'good'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, open the pronunciation tab and notice the phonetics. Write ᎠᏅᏱ again,<br>with the correct phonetics and the meaning, as in the example above.</p>

<p>You will have noticed an ""h"" sound that wasn't written in the syllabary word. It is called an ""intrusive h,""<br>sometimes referred to just as ""unole,"" or air. You can't see an intrusive h when looking at syllabary characters, but you will learn where they belong by listening to speakers, and by paying attention to phonetics.</p>

<p>Whether a word has in intrusive h or not can affect its meaning. For example, ᎪᏪᎵᎠ can be spelled phonetically:</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"">
<p><em>go-<u>hwe</u>-li-a</em>         'He or she is writing it,' or <em>go-<u>we</u>-li-a</em>            'I am writing it'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>'When I travelled through the Cherokee Nation, during the months of January and February, 1828, before the press was set up, or any printing had been executed in the alphabet of Guess, I was informed in many parts of the nation, that almost all the young and middle aged men could read in that alphabet, with many of the old men, and of the women, and of the children. One very old Cherokee man came to a place where I spent a night, to obtain a sheet of paper, for the purpose of writing a letter to a friend, residing among that portion of the tribe west of the Mississippi. When asked if he could write, he replied that he could not, but that his son had learned the new letters and could write what he told him. A small full-Cherokee boy, who had been received into one of the schools from a very ignorant part of the nation, totally unacquainted with the English language, except that he was beginning to<br>learn the alphabet, was requested to read a few lines in the characters of Guess, that were printed in Boston merely as a specimen of the language. He read it correctly, and without hesitation.</p>

<p>'I frequently saw, as I rode from place to place, Cherokee letters painted or cut on the trees by the road side, on fences, houses, and often on pieces of bark or board, lying about the houses. The alphabet of Guess had never been taught in schools. The people have learned it from one another; and that too without books, or paper, or any of the common facilities for writing or teaching. They cut the letters, or drew them with a piece of coal, or with paint. Bark, trees, fences, the walls of houses &c. answered the purpose of paper or slates.'</p>

<p>'That the mass of a people, without schools or books, should by mutual assistance, without extraneous impulse or aid, acquire the art of reading, and that in a character wholly original, is, I believe, a phenomenon unexampled in modern times.'</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Cherokee language has a number of suffixes that perform their own special functions, such as to create transitions or ask questions. These special suffixes are called &lsquo;clitics.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The word &#x13d9;&#x13af; <i>tohi</i> by itself means &lsquo;calm,&rsquo; &lsquo;peaceful&rsquo; or &lsquo;at peace.&rsquo; The clitic -&#x13e8; <i>-tsv</i> is a very common regional or speaker-specific variant of -&#x13e7; <i>-tsu</i>. Together, &#x13d9;&#x13af;&#x13e7; <i>tohitsu </i>literally means &lsquo;Is it peaceful?&rsquo; but it is used to mean &lsquo;Are you well?&rsquo; or loosely, &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; In a fuller sense, the word can mean, &lsquo;Are you well? It appears you are, I have no reason to believe otherwise, so expect you to say yes!&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The clitic -&#x13e7; &ndash;<i>tsu</i> is used to ask yes-or-no questions, primarily when a yes response is anticipated.</span></p>

<textarea cols=""100"" rows=""5"">They both start with an O-sound prefix (osdi-/osd- for dual, otsi-/ots- for plural). Both forms exclude the person being spoken to ('you').</textarea></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cherokee has quite a versatile system for building tenses. It is **VERY** different from the English system of modals, helping verbs and participles to indicate tense, mood and voice. Most Cherokee verbs have five **aspect stems,** base forms that indicate some characteristic of the action being described,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to which an ending will be attached. For the verb &#x13a1;&#x13b5;&#x13a0; <i>eli&rsquo;a</i> &lsquo;he/she thinks so&rsquo; you have already learned the **present continuous (ongoing)** aspect stem and the present tense ending:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#x13a1;&#x13b5;&#x13a0; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>eli&rsquo;a</i><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;he/she thinks so&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In contrast, the use of the **immediate aspect stem** indicates that the action happened just now, or should happen immediately, relative to the Cherokee idea of &#x13aa;&#x13af; <i>kohi </i>&ldquo;the current moment&rdquo; which can last from a few minutes to several hours, but is **not** happening right now. So the immediate aspect stem will be used to form the immediate past and immediate command forms of a verb.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Notice the difference among the following pair of words:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&#x13a0;&#x13a6;&#x13cd;&#x13a6;.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Agasga.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is raining (single instance).</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&#x13a0;&#x13a6;&#x13cd;&#x13a6; <i>agasga </i>means simply that it is raining right now, and only the current instance of rainfall is being described. **&#x13d3;&#x13a6;&#x13cd;&#x13a6; <i>dagasga</i>** on the other hand means that it is raining right now and there have been other periods of rainfall observed recently in addition to the current instance.

"1d6b2e66-1d19-4b64-b388-0c0ebde7dc34","cwkw-weaving-civic-life","/cwkw/weaving-civic-life","Weaving Civic Life","<h3>Written by Ellen Cushman, Ben Frey, and Rachel C. Jackson</h3>
<p>Cherokee people tell a story of ᎧᎵᏁᏚᏙ kahnanesgi, Waterspider, who brought the embers of the first fire to all the beings on the earth. Waterspider wove a bowl from her web and secured it on her back. She swam to an island where a tree had caught fire and placed tiny embers in the bowl, then returned to the shore where all the animals waited. The fire singed her and the embers burned through the bowl on her back, leaving a permanent red mark. She was hailed as the most courageous of beings. Storytelling is one of the many means for writing about and writing within cultures we will take up in this class. Storytelling serves a civic purpose: stories carry social obligation and place-based knowledge.</p>
<p>As with Waterspider, who wove a webbed basket to bring an ember to all beings, Cherokee basket weaving and writing of everyday life create an inner container and an outer wall– a visible face for a hidden interior life that together forms a strong basket for carrying lifeways forward. Weaving this way evokes a building up, coming together, containing, and protecting. It suggests a flexible structure created within a balancing and jointly constructed effort. Weaving also suggests how the interior is built around a central element around which we organize ourselves and insulate ourselves from outside pressures.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" class=""size-medium wp-image-2035 alignright"" src=""https://wp.dailp.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dye_colors_basket-300x282.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""282"" srcset=""https://wp.dailp.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dye_colors_basket-300x282.jpg 300w, https://wp.dailp.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dye_colors_basket-768x721.jpg 768w, https://wp.dailp.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dye_colors_basket-1024x961.jpg 1024w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"" />Cherokee baskets are double-walled. The basket's interior is woven first, with a runner moving over and under structuring reeds. When the interior wall is woven upward and outward to the desired depth, the structuring reeds are bent over the outside of the interior wall. The runner then continues over and under the structuring reeds, moving down the length of the first wall until the second exterior wall is complete. The remaining structuring reeds are tucked between the interior and exterior walls to create a firm foundation on which the basket sits.</p>
<p>The cover page of <i>Cherokee Writing the Keetoowah Way</i> is inspired by Cherokee basketry, stories, and the pages brought together in our collection. The outer and inner walls of the design evoke the weaving of Cherokee civic life throughout the pages of our collection. As pictured here in a basket woven by <em><strong>Lena Stick</strong></em>, Cherokee baskets are colorful, drawing their dyes from the plants and trees found in Cherokee homelands past and present. Bloodroot, black walnut, and buckbrush tan inspire the framing of the pages of our digital collection. The black walnut dye evokes the grounding of the collection in everyday life and the writings of the Cherokee. The buckbrush tan evokes gathering, bringing together, and building an interior and exterior life and community.

<h1>&#x13ac;&#x13c2;&#x13a8;&#x13d2; &#x13a2;&#x13ef;&#x13db;&#x13c1;&#x13af; &ndash; Introduction</h1>
<p>The following examples represent the simple subject &ndash; verb sentence structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 280px;""><i>wesa nigawe</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 280px;"">cat &ndash; it is meowing (making a noise)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 280px;"">&lsquo;A cat is meowing.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 320px;"">
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 280px;"">s<i>asa naniwe</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 280px;"">geese &ndash; they are honking</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 280px;"">&lsquo;Some geese are honking.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*You&rsquo;ll notice that there are no articles such as &lsquo;a/an&rsquo; or &lsquo;some&rsquo; in Cherokee. These articles are implied in the structure of the sentence. As we will see in the examples that follow, the article <i>na</i> can be used to mean &lsquo;that/the&rsquo; depending on the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>Typically in simple declarative statements, sentences in Cherokee take on a subject &ndash; object &ndash; verb word order. However, to reverse this structure is not always incorrect, as we will see in the following examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na agehya gitli agowatiha</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">the &ndash; woman &ndash; dog &ndash; she sees</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The woman sees a dog.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>gitli agowatiha na agehya</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">dog &ndash; she sees &ndash; the &ndash; woman</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The woman sees a dog.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>udohiyu udlvkwsati na achutsa</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">really &ndash; he is a braggart &ndash; the/that boy</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The boy really is a braggart.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice sentences two and three. In both examples, the subject of the sentence is placed at the end of the sentence, pulling the object into primary focus. Sentence three, the adjective <i>udlvkwsati</i> is made the focal point of the sentence, and then towards the end of the sentence we are given our subject &ndash; <i>na achuja/achutsa</i> &lsquo;the boy&rsquo;.</p>

<h1>Sentences Involving Adjectives</h1>
<p>Adjectives function in various ways in Cherokee sentence structure. In the two examples below, the adjective is placed before the noun and verb yielding the following translations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>usdi gitli atlido&rsquo;a</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">little &ndash; dog &ndash; (it) is running around</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;A little dog is running around.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na utana yona nigawe&rsquo;a</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">the &ndash; big &ndash; bear &ndash; (it) is growling</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The big bear is growling.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next way that adjectives can be used in a sentence is by adding the adjective after a noun which gives the meaning of &lsquo;[it] is ______.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na tsisqua gigage&rsquo;i</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">the &ndash; bird &ndash; it is red</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The bird is red.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na nvya uwodige&rsquo;i</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">the &ndash; rock &ndash; it is brown</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The rock is brown.&rsquo;</p>

<h1>Sentences Involving Both Adjectives and Verbs</h1>
<p>In these examples, you will see that adverbs in Cherokee typically precede the verb and come after the noun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na usdi gitli ayanuli atlido&rsquo;a</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">the &ndash; little &ndash; dog &ndash; fast &ndash; (it&rsquo;s) running</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The little dog is running fast.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na utana yona sdaya nigawe&rsquo;a</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">the &ndash; big &ndash; bear &ndash; loud &ndash; it&rsquo;s making noise</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;The big bear is growling loudly.&rsquo;</p>

<h1>Sentences Without Verbs</h1>
<p>In the late Durbin Feeling&rsquo;s <em>Outline of Cherokee Grammar</em>, he relates how not all sentences in Cherokee will exhibit a verb. To make this more clear, he provides the following examples to illustrate how some nouns and adjectives in Cherokee already contain a verb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>na asgaya agidoda</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">that &ndash; man &ndash; he is father to me</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;That man is my father.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><em>a</em><i>gidoda utana</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">my father &ndash; he is big</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;My father is big.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>&lsquo;To Be&rsquo;</h1>
<p>The verb &lsquo;to be&rsquo; functions differently in Cherokee than it does in English. Many Cherokee verbs, as well as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, already have &lsquo;to be&rsquo; built into the word itself.</p>

<h1>Passive Sentence Construction</h1>
<p>Passive voice is used when the action is being done to someone or when the person doing the action is unknown. Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples from Durbin Feeling&rsquo;s <i>Outline of Cherokee Grammar</i> that demonstrate a simple example of the passive sentence structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>asgaya atsigowhtiha</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">man &ndash; he is being seen</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;A man is being seen.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>vgigowhtiha</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;I am being seen.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>asgaya ugohwtiha agehya</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">man &ndash; she is being seen &ndash; woman</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">&lsquo;A woman is being seen by a man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at some examples that can be found in the DAILP collections:</p>

<h1>Sentences with Prepositions</h1>
<p>There are few prepositions in Cherokee that function on their own. For the most part, prepositions are found intertwined in the Cherokee verb. Below are some examples of prepositions that stand on their own, drawn from Durbin Feeling&rsquo;s <i>Outline of Cherokee Grammar</i>.</p>
<p><i>gvhdi</i>: &lsquo;with, using&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;""><i>yonega gvhdi gawoniha</i></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 240px;"">English &ndash; with &ndash; s/he is speaking</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we begin to expand our collections at DAILP, </span><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/home/team/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">our team also begins to grow</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Our archive of Cherokee syllabary documents are translated by members of the Cherokee community and speakers of the Cherokee language, as well linguists, professors, students, and scholars from a range of fields. This multidisciplinary, inclusive approach to our team of scholars reflects our value of community in DAILP's role as being an accessible learning tool for all.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We want you to get to know the dedicated people behind this project. How are they interacting with DAILP's work directly in their own lives and communities? To that end, we're pleased to announce our latest story series: </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">DAILP Team Spotlights</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This month, we sat down with core team member </span><b>Hazelyn Aroian</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a second-year CS and English student at Northeastern University. Hazelyn primarily works as DAILP's Web Content Developer for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. She also contributes to many teams central to DAILP's work, including creating the display for curricular materials online, annotating audio files, and working with Rust and SQL to migrate and store data within our database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this spotlight, Hazelyn describes an important experience she had while at </span><a href=""https://wp.dailp.northeastern.edu/stories/ukb-advisory-board-members-translators-discover-family-voices-in-dailps-work/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the UKB visit last May</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, in which the team discovered that the label for a mode of transcription did not accurately reflect the way that most native Cherokee speakers spoke the language. The experience struck Hazelyn, especially as a CS student: certain elements of design can initially seem like a small choice, but these carry important implications or risk assumptions that may not reflect the community accurately. From both technical and communicative points of view, she realized that the interface built between DAILP and UKB citizens is a key factor in the workflow pertaining to her own role at DAILP.</span></p>
<p><b>________</b></p>
<p><strong>Can you describe what took place during the UKB visit?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""During the UKB visit, we had one specific meeting where our development team was showing members various changes to the interface through which we display documents. Though at this point I wasn't doing any work with the development team, I was paying close attention, since the conversation was relevant to the sort of work I'd hopefully be doing in the future. The team began having a discussion about which form of transcription we default to on the website for the Cherokee syllabary, and what we've chosen to label that specific form of transcription. A few members of the UKB brought up where exactly that form of transcription originated from and how it is much more common for Cherokee learners whose first language is English to pronounce words in that way rather than native Cherokee speakers who transcribe the syllabary. For example, take the difference between </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">transliterating Cherokee ᏣᎳᎩ as tsalagi or jalagi. The former spelling is preferred by Cherokee speakers and learners who grew up with that spelling in their homes and communities.</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> We realized we needed to relabel some dropdown menus in order to ensure the distinction was clear.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>What about this particular instance was meaningful to you?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""As a CS major, this exchange really hammered home the fact that people who are developing software or structuring digital spaces, like our digital archive, need to have a very clear idea of the goal or desired outcome, significance, and context behind a project. It showed me how choices that may at first seem inconsequential, such as which mode to default to or what to call an option on a dropdown menu, can powerfully shape [the] beliefs visitors [to] our site may form.""</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I began to </span></i><b><i>realize the type of attention to detail I would need</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to cultivate in order </span></i><b><i>to accurately represent the intent behind a project.</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""</span></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><b>If you could choose ONE takeaway from this visit, what would it be and why do you think it's an important takeaway?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""…As someone writing code or developing a technical solution, a clear understanding of the problem, as well as the wider context of the problem, is essential. I think this is the biggest takeaway, since other takeaways– ways to work with the community in order to develop that wider context, the importance of workplace communication– are kind of informed by the process of gaining that understanding.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>The importance of technical development seems to be complex. What aspects on this front do you think are most important to consider when developing an interface like DAILP's?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""With DAILP in mind, I think it's important to remember who our audience is, and the fact that we are designing our archive with the Cherokee community foremost, but we may also be reaching people who are unfamiliar with Cherokee language or culture.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>As a CS student, what aspects of technical development does DAILP succeed at, from your point of view? How does DAILP approach technical development differently compared to other places, in your experience?</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""I really love how DAILP treats technical development as one very integrated component of a wider approach. Anyone who writes code for DAILP is encouraged to also contribute during wider team meetings when we discuss specific content or project strategy relating to community engagement… This creates a culture where people involved in technical aspects of the project are really thinking about those other aspects as well.""</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""…</span></i><b><i>we are developing an archive and interface to serve the wider community</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. So, it's not only important that our team has a clear sense of the goal at hand, but that the community understands what options they have through the interface… and [know] our processes and the technology well enough to </span></i><b><i>be empowered to speak up when changes should be made</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.""</span></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><b>As someone who has a hand in both spaces, what can you say about the relationship between technical development and content creation at DAILP?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Something that's been really interesting to me as I've done work for both our content team and development team is recognizing how important accountability and transparency are to each team, [and] how we go about maintaining those common goals in slightly different ways. In terms of technical development, it may mean writing clear code that's easily readable, efficient, and reusable. In terms of content, it means being precise either with visuals or words.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In both cases, it means giving credit where credit's due– like figuring out how we can best credit community members for their work and contributions across our site or making sure to acknowledge each team member's contribution to the code.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>Can you think of any other specific times while working at DAILP that have changed or layered your way of working/thinking?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Yes– I always really enjoy meetings where people come together to discuss DAILP strategies across various teams, in addition to events like the UKB visit. One recent meeting that comes to mind was one where we discussed the DAILP's communication strategy– it really helped shape my understanding of communication about a project as a means both for engagement and accountability.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>You mention transparent communication as playing a pivotal role in developing engagement with our community members. Could you elaborate on what communication (or community) looks like to you?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""I've found [that] I communicate best when I have a very clear understanding of how my work fits into the project overall, and I also appreciate how great DAILP is at valuing each individual's work and really allowing individuals to gain that larger picture.""</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""I'm really grateful for the way </span></i><b><i>everyone at</i></b> <b><i>DAILP has been so supportive of me, </i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">[allowing me to]</span></i> <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">try different things in different areas of the project. </span></i><b><i>This sort of openness has really influenced my beliefs on what a technical project should look like</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">…""</span></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As she continues her education and prepares to go on co-op next semester, Hazelyn remains deeply interested in questions related to ethics of technology. She looks forward to continuing work on DAILP's Audio Team and Development Team this semester.</span></p>"
"eeb52e19-0443-4f5f-bc95-7c457047f0b6","dailp-spotlight-meg-cassidy","/spotlight/meg-cassidy","DAILP Spotlight: Meg Cassidy","<p>Meg Cassidy is an undergraduate student at Northeastern University, driven by her immense passion for writing, language and culture. Meg has been involved with DAILP since January of 2023, when she met Professor Ellen Cushman in her ""Writing Cultures"" class. Despite not being a part of the Cherokee community herself, Meg knows how it feels to be disconnected from your cultural history and native tongue by colonization. Meg's family spans back generations to Irish ancestry. Before British colonization, the people of Ireland spoke Gaelic as their primary language. This colonization brought attempts to exterminate the native language and force the country to assimilate into the English tongue. Meg's parents moved from Ireland to Boston in the 2000s, bringing with them their love of their people and their heritage!&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so, because of her desire to utilize language to cultivate community, Meg was ecstatic when she was presented the opportunity to join the DAILP team! Her passion for the project and its goals has only grown since.</p>

<p>Meg's involvement with DAILP began with becoming familiar with the Cherokee language, correcting discovered errors in the project database based on community feedback. Her role now is more centered around her interest in professional writing, working to craft stories&nbsp; about the project and the amazing, hardworking people that make it all happen! Her stories have ranged from discussing the impact of language preservation on native communities to describing what the team's editors found meaningful from their work!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being interested in writing since childhood, it means a lot to Meg that she has been able to further develop her passion in a way that benefits her and her community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of Meg's family who are still living in Ireland speak Gaelic as their primary language in their household, refusing to let go of their language and history. Meg has always aspired to learn Gaelic; a goal she is only beginning to undertake. She has learned the history that was stolen from the Irish people. She has grown up hearing stories about the devastation that resulted from British colonization and its legacy. Meg's parents recognized the limitations of living in their homeland and made the bold decision to leave. They sought more for their children. Meg understands what it means to have imperial tragedy woven into a culture, language, and history of a people. She's dedicated to working with her team and community members to persist with and document the language with the Cherokee people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writing for DAILP has helped Meg reconnect with her heritage: to understand what was lost, and what can still be recovered. She is beyond proud to be a part of the larger effort to resist language loss: to preserve the words, traditions and stories that define Cherokee culture.&nbsp;</p>"

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Good news: we have another </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">DAILP Team Spotlight</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to share with you! This November, we had the pleasure of interviewing DAILP's current linguistic annotator, </span><b>Melissa Torres</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Melissa is a fifth-year student at Northeastern University studying a combined major of Linguistics and Psychology. Currently a one-person department on our core team, Melissa has been working diligently on community commentary documents and filling in any corrections on texts, which included finishing up the </span><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/willie-jumper-stories""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Willie Jumper Stories collection</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> over the past summer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this spotlight, Melissa discusses how she learned to annotate and translate the Cherokee syllabary with no previous experience or encounters with the language, aside from an intensive linguistic annotation course that she took over the summer with </span><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/home/team/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dr. Jeffrey Bourns</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Despite her short-term experience with Cherokee, Melissa was able to make remarkable strides and contribute to the growing amount of translated texts. Melissa also highlights her career goals as a future social worker or speech pathologist for children, and how she hopes her work at DAILP will carry over in improving childrens' lives when it comes to an understanding of language. Her insights in this interview illuminate a path to how DAILP showcases their learning tools in an accessible way for beginning speakers and learners of Cherokee, regardless of age and linguistic background.</span></p>
<p><b>________</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>How did you get involved with DAILP and when were you introduced to the Cherokee language?</strong><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I was first introduced to the Cherokee language in Spring 2022 when taking my senior seminar course with Dr. Jeffrey Bourns, DAILP's own language specialist. After several months of trial and error to learn the Cherokee syllabary writing system and proper annotation, Jeff suggested that I continue my work throughout the summer. This is when I was introduced to the core team and have been taking on new responsibilities [at DAILP] since. </span></i><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>As a non-native speaker, what challenges have you faced when it comes to learning the Cherokee syllabary?&nbsp; </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most difficult part of learning the syllabary was distinguishing the characters that differed in only one slight shape or directional change. This, paired with the sheer number of characters used (85!), took days of practice and frequent refreshing to memorize. </span></i><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>As a first-time learner, what are some of the positives and negatives to having no background in the language prior to your intensive course?</b> <b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A positive was my lack of knowledge in the language's structure. This made the morphemic segmentation of words much simpler because I was not trying to fit words into a type of ""structure"" that was common to the language. Negatively, I had no mental vocabulary bank when translating individual words, so I had to rely heavily on the Cherokee-English Dictionary, which was very time consuming. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><b>Do you speak (or have studied) any other languages? </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">English is my only fluent language. However, I have gone through four years of Spanish classes and two years of American Sign Language (ASL), which I feel moderately proficient in. Growing up, I was introduced to a handful of simple words in Portuguese and Polish by my parents, but the full languages were unfortunately not passed down to my siblings or me. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><b>What learning tools or techniques have helped you overcome the challenges you mentioned before? Do you have any tricks, tips, or advice for those visiting our site who would like to start learning the Cherokee language and syllabary for the first time?</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As suggested during my seminar course by Jeff (Dr. Bourns), mnemonics! During the first week of the course, we were instructed to pair mental images with names that corresponded to the phonetics of the Syllabary characters. Jeff exemplified this by pairing a picture of Lady </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ga</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ga with her arms out to represent the character /Ꭶ/ 'ga.' This, combined with drilling a long Quizlet flashcard set, made the characters much easier to differentiate. </span></i><b><i><br />
</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><b>Is there anything you would like to incorporate or contribute to DAILP's interface before your time with us has come to a close? Moreover, are there any ways you think would improve the site in becoming more accessible to first-time learners of Cherokee? </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I would love to spend my remaining time working on publishing new Cherokee texts. It means a great deal to me that my efforts are making these materials more accessible while also preserving the language for years to come.&nbsp;</span></em><b><br />
</b></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><b><i>""…I believe DAILP to be widely accessible in terms of different ages and skill levels due to its various resources under the Tools and Teaching tabs. I would love to incorporate the idea of mnemonics (and that Quizlet set!) to ease learning.""</i></b></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><b>As someone who will work with kids in the future, how would you go about introducing the Cherokee syllabary to a child without any background in the language? </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lots of pictures! When I first learned the English alphabet in my Kindergarten class, we did coloring worksheets where each letter was paired with an animal whose name began with that letter. Developing similar worksheets with animal pictures whose Cherokee names begin with each Syllabary character could be a first step. </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With my potential future career options and my current job as a childhood educator, children are at the heart of what I want to do.&nbsp; Conveniently, mnemonics are excellent educational tools, especially in situations where a child might not have the means to communicate verbally. Using pictures, actions, symbols, or even ASL will help me to better understand their needs and requests wherever I may end up. </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></i><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>Do you feel that you contribute to the persistence of people or community as an annotator? What do you think is something others in your field may not realize is important when it comes to translating another community's language?&nbsp; </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I feel that others do not recognize the importance of culturally-specific words or plays on words. During my work, I have picked up on how many Cherokee terms do not have exact equivalents in other languages. You cannot gain fluency from study alone; you must immerse yourself in the language or culture to gain full knowledge.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><b><i>""As an annotator, I also get to incorporate commentary that comes directly from Cherokee speakers and community members. To me, this is the most worthwhile part of what I do, since the annotation not only introduces the language, but adds depth. DAILP gathers direct feedback that teaches the audience about unique cultural terms and generational language change.""</i></b></h2>

<p>Milan has been involved with DAILP since she was first introduced to the project by her linguistics professor in the fall of 2023. Originally, she came to Northeastern to study physics with the goal of going to medical school, a journey that took her from the physics department to the biology department and finally, to her home in the linguistics department. She finds that linguistics perfectly marries the humanities and the sciences.</p>

<p>Milan has always had a deep fascination with words and language. Milan's mom would bring her to programs at their local library and read stories to her at bedtime. When her mom eventually retires, Milan hopes to run her own ""Library on Wheels,"" going to different disadvantaged neighborhoods and bringing books to children who might otherwise not have access to them. Milan came to adore reading because her mom was such a huge activist for her literacy. Milan came to cherish individual words and how they combine to become something more than the sum of their parts; they become language, which she now gets the chance to explore every day with DAILP and in her linguistics major. As well as English, she can speak French and Chinese. </p>

<p>Additionally, she is involved in the Northeastern Linguistics Club and Health Disparities Collaborative, a group focused on minimizing health disparities across the globe. In Summer of 2024, she traveled to Scotland to explore the Gaelic language, which, though impacted by colonial legacies, is currently experiencing a resurgence around the globe. It was here she fell in love with travel. She imagines herself traveling all over the world, learning language after language after language.</p>

<p>Milan credits her interest in helping historically silenced communities to her own experience growing up in Long Island, New York, where she lived in a considerably disadvantaged neighborhood. Having directly experienced the financial limitations of her upbringing, Milan understands just how essential education is for understanding each other across cultures, across linguistic boundaries. Education unites us.</p>

<p>Her involvement with DAILP is wide-ranging! She first began with linguistic glossing and studying translation tables of the Cherokee language. Most recently, she has been integrating our audio files collected from fluent community members into the instructional materials found in <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw/teaching-learning""><em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em></a>, bringing the magic of spoken word to the website! Her love for the project is clear, in both her words and her actions. She appreciates the opportunity to make an impact on her community, the opportunity to be a part of something bigger than herself, something important and lasting.</p>

<p>Milan is currently applying to graduate schools to continue her linguistic studies. Looking forward, she hopes to become an academic professor, helping others to understand the sheer beauty and importance of sharing culture, sharing traditions, and sharing language.</p>"

<p>Mary ᎺᎵ Rae has been key to DAILP's goal of promoting indigenous language learning and persistence. In <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW), </em>she created instructional resources from our translated documents, including learning resources on the syllabary, information about day-to-day words, conversational phrases, and conversation starters.

<p>Mary ᎺᎵ Rae first started learning Cherokee later in life through her teacher Ed Fields, a Cherokee Nation language instructor, who sparked her dedication to the Cherokee language and community through his teaching process of explaining words from the speakers' point of view, and illustrating Cherokee thinking through storytelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;""And there's so many things he would bring out about the Cherokee language really showing you how the words picture what they're saying,"" Mary ᎺᎵ Rae explained during our interview.<strong> ""</strong>So it gets you out of the habit of thinking, oh, there's an equivalent word for this in English. It translates to this. And sort of helps you to be thinking about when you see or hear that word, you're seeing a picture. And that is extremely unique.""</p>

<p>Her lifelong goal is to think in Cherokee and understand the lens of Cherokee speakers, which translates into her contributions to the DAILP team and its curriculum.&nbsp;Mary ᎺᎵ Rae began with DAILP's curricular materials seven years ago by developing a set of digital lessons out of document translations. For the last 18 months, Mary ᎺᎵ Rae has been developing the audio listening labs during the second phase of the project. She was eager to develop the recordings to go along with the translations in <em><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw/reading-and-writing"">Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</a>. </em>The audio files liven the practice of language with the combination of the audio, writing, archival documentation, and transcription.&nbsp;""It's very important to be able to hear the words and how to pronounce. But it goes way beyond just pronunciation. It's about hearing words in context. Becoming aware of similarities and related words. And this helps you understand without having to grasp after the meanings of every word…. For thousands of years, Cherokee was just spoken and not written. And this is how you learn.""<br><br>The lessons help learners to engage with Cherokee and allow learners, especially second language learners such as herself, to activate their interests and develop their ideas with accessibility. ""It's more about awakening interest. And showing students that their ideas are important too. And they can have their own way to approach Cherokee. There's not just one way to learn. Everybody's different.""&nbsp;Mary ᎺᎵ Rae's work in this way has helped learners by providing new resources and creating a multifaceted, comprehensible space for acquiring knowledge. Her tremendous influence on DAILP's digital collection, <em><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw"">Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW)</a>, </em>has played a crucial role in shaping DAILP into what it is today. We are honored to have Mary ᎺᎵ Rae within our DAILP community who opens such a pathway to the Cherokee language and learning.</p>

<p>Beginning in the early 1930s, Cherokee composer and bandleader Carl T. Fischer (1912-1954) was working on a multi-movement orchestral suite called <em>Reflections of an Indian Boy</em>&nbsp; – a project left unfinished after his sudden passing at the age of 41. While his nine-movement composition was never fully completed, a condensed version of the piece for piano was reconstructed from home audio recordings and fully orchestrated, leading to it being recorded on Columbia Records. Over a half of a century later, his grandson, <a href=""https://justinmorell.com/blog/"">Dr. Justin Morell</a>, embarked on a generational, musical mission of his own.</p>

<p>An alum of both California State University East Bay and UCLA, <a href=""https://justinmorell.com/blog/bio/"">Morell comes from a family of guitarists, composers, and musicians</a>, and holds a PhD from the University of Oregon. Currently, Morell teaches a variety of music composition, music theory, and orchestration courses at <a href=""https://www.lvc.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/music/our-faculty/dr-justin-morell/"">Lebanon Valley College</a> in Pennsylvania as an Associate Professor in Music. Morell created an orchestral composition titled ""<a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/"">18 Echoes in Cherokee</a>"", that encompasses DAILP's English translations of the <a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/the-texts/"">Dollie Duncan letters and more</a>. Morell used short excerpts from the collection of letters to illustrate the dialogues in a new light, promote Cherokee language preservation, and commemorate the work of his late grandfather in a creative, meaningful, auditory experience. The concerto is performed and recorded by Grammy-winning trumpeter, <a href=""https://www.johndaversa.com/biography"">John Daversa</a>, and it includes a number of Cherokee vocalist performers and Cherokee instrumentalists. Begun in 2021, the project was finished in 2024 and is now available at: <a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/"">https://www.18echoes.com/</a></p>

<p>In conversation with his grandfather's music, Morell included instrumental movements based on Fischer's original nine movements in <em>Reflections of an Indian Boy</em>. They are paired with vocal movements sung in Cherokee, and will integrate with excerpts of the historical artifacts that DAILP has to offer to emphasize Cherokee language perseverance. ""The Cherokee Project"" is not the first time the California native has experimented with vocalizations in his orchestral compositions; in&nbsp;<em>John Daversa Jazz Orchestra featuring Justin Morell: <a href=""https://www.allwithoutwords.org/""><em>All Without Words: variations inspired by Lore</em></a></em>&nbsp;(2021), which is described as ""a concerto for trumpet with jazz orchestra and choir,"" Morell&nbsp;incorporates vocalizations inspired by his autistic non-verbal son into the music. In addition to DAILP's Dollie Duncan letters, Morell worked with <a href=""https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/slsnyder.aspx"">Dr. Sara Snyder-Hopkins</a>, the Director of the Cherokee Language Program at Western Carolina University, to include more day-to-day historical excerpts into the project. Morell has clarified that the composition does not include any sacred texts of the Cherokee people.</p>

<p>Our team is thrilled to see (and hear!) the music found in Morell's use of the translated <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/dollie-duncan-letters"">Dollie Duncan letters</a>, which have been graciously translated by DAILP translators and community members Clara Proctor and Ernestine Berry.<strong> (</strong>Accredited translators and annotators for all of our documents can be found under the ""view details"" links above each archival document on our site). Morell reached out to DAILP founder Dr. Ellen Cushman in the spring of 2021 to seek permission to use these documents as part of his composition. The ᎨᏳᎠ ᎠᏂᎦᎳᎩ (Dollie Duncan) collection on DAILP includes letters written from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary by ᎠᏉ ᎠᏂᎦ (Walter Duncan) to his mother Dollie with help from his fellow prisoner, ᎠᎵᏣᏤᎩᏍ ᎣᎨᎵ (Following Star). The collection sheds light on Cherokee inmate camaraderie in the 1950s. Morell emphasized that DAILP's interactions with the prisoners' letters would prove to be a vital component to the completion of the musical project.</p>

<p>The DAILP team gladly invites contributions to the collections' translations and other collaborations in the future. In fact, DAILP implemented a Creative Commons license for scholars, composers, and content developers for those who are inspired to use these documents in their own creative ventures. The DAILP team is pleased to share in creative projects like Morell's that seek to enable Cherokee language persistence and community. DAILP plans to continue supporting Morell's creative project, <a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/"">18 Echoes in Cherokee</a>, and assist in helping him achieve his mission of ""celebrating the beauty and complexity of Cherokee culture and language."" </p>"

<p>The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence (DAILP) is a project rooted in language but more specifically, the transmission of language. DAILP collects manuscripts containing Cherokee syllabary, meticulously translating their content to English. The digital edited collection, <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em>, contains translations of eighty-seven Cherokee syllabary documents! ""With only about 2,000 native Cherokee speakers, many of whom are in their 70s or older,"" DAILP's manuscript translations serve to connect Cherokee speakers to learners by translating the words and stories of the Cherokee people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pored over by teams of students, linguists and Cherokee community members, the translation of Cherokee manuscripts is only possible through intense collaboration. The translators and editors, who tend to the intricacies of the texts in their untranslated state, play an integral part of this effort to document and practice the Cherokee language. Editors introduce the translations collected in these pages, describing their lasting importance and framing them in Cherokee lifeways and history. Through this transformation, the untold stories of the Cherokee people are formed in vivid detail and lost words are rediscovered!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As co-editors with Ellen Cushman, Rachel Jackson and Ben Fry helped make the <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em> project come to life. </p>

<p>Jackson also communicates her appreciation for the written component of this project. As fewer Cherokee people are able to speak or write Cherokee, practice with the written form of the Cherokee syllabary can be lost through time. Having a digital space dedicated to the preservation of the written syllabary is, according to Jackson, ""innovative and game changing.""&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ben Fry, assistant professor of American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and citizen of the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians, also appreciates what this project means to the greater effort to preserve indigenous language. Fry notes this project's potential to help create ""more pedagogical materials for the classroom."" Arguing that this collection opens up new opportunities for linguistic ""data analysis"" and research of the Cherokee language's ""word order,"" Fry believes the translations of these numerous manuscripts serve as educational materials to further spread knowledge of the Cherokee language! <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em> is a project that actively aims to preserve language in a digital and accessible way, focusing on the written syllabary of the Cherokee people to continue learning and teaching the language. Through the collaboration of editors who deeply care about the Cherokee language, DAILP aims to provide ""sustained exposure and accessibility that any scholar, student or any interested community member who can have access to at any time."" In this way, DAILP creates a digital community space for anyone to learn from and read stories unique to the Cherokee people that they can ""relate to and respect.""</p>

<p>The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence (DAILP) understands language persistence and preservation as mutually sustaining endeavors for Indigenous peoples today. The DAILP team works tirelessly to build and maintain ""a collaborative online space to facilitate communications between indigenous language learners, speakers, and scholars."" DAILP understands that language is more than the words we speak, more than the rules of form and grammar we learn. Languages fundamentally connect people to shared histories, lands, and ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For hundreds of years, European colonists and settlers coming to America have occupied the lands of indigenous peoples. Along with the intrusion of their physical homelands, Indigenous peoples have suffered the everyday erosion of their own languages and with that loss, their lifeways. In 1491, the land of the Americas included over 2,000 indigenous languages to a mere 245, ""65 [of which] are already extinct and 75 are moving in that direction."" And yet, languages remain as their impact is understood to be fundamental to human connection.</p>

<p>Bri Alexander, a research associate at DAILP who works with and is enrolled in the Cherokee Nation and Shawnee Tribe describes the importance of language best: ""Cherokee in particular is very descriptive, and there's a lot more verbs than nouns. So, it's a doing language and a descriptive language. You just relate differently to the world when you're speaking Cherokee."" The Cherokee language emphasizes one's physical movement through the world, appreciating it in a way that is lost in other languages. Through language, we learn how to experience the world and further, how we ourselves fit into it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>John Chewey, a member of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, works with the DAILP team as a translation specialist. As a result of his participation, he has translated words he has never used before; words that have been largely forgotten over time. John Chewey declared that DAILP's digital collection of written Cherokee has helped him expand his knowledge of the language in ways he didn't predict possible. Not only does this practice of preserving indigenous language help non-speakers to familiarize themselves with the language but it also helps lifelong community members reconnect with their roots!&nbsp;</p>

<p>DAILP teams have been guided in their work by the UKB translation team led by Ernestine Berry, Director of the John Hair Cultural Museum and Archive. Their team identified many precious Cherokee language documents; documents ranging from funeral notices to love letters to cultural stories. John Chewey has even recorded audio for some of these stories, really bringing them to life and honoring the cultural significance behind them. Thus, this project also works to bridge the gap between spoken and written language!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next step of DAILP is working to finalize its reading and writing environments and piloting a prototype of the software with Cherokee teachers, learners, and speakers. The ultimate goal is to support the continued persistence of indigenous languages, while also preserving more of the Cherokee language to further unite communities. The DAILP project serves as more than a digital effort to immortalize an indigenous language in danger. It cultivates a community of indigenous community members, scholars, and interested newcomers who want to explore the language together and develop our understanding of what it means to communicate and further, what it means to connect.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This May, DAILP had the pleasure of hosting three members of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) on the Boston campus of Northeastern University in Massachusetts. Thanks to the sponsorship of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) grant from the National Archives, DAILP team members and UKB citizens visited together to discuss a variety of language- and community-based practices. Guests included UKB citizens Clara Proctor and Oletta Pritchett, UKB citizen and DAILP advisory board member Ernestine Berry, and DAILP advisory board member Lisa Conathan. Other </span><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/home/team/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">core team members</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of DAILP were present for various parts of the visit to take notes and discuss with our guests. After a warm welcome on the first evening of their arrival, day two laid the foundation for the visit, which consisted of storytelling, a presentation from Berry, discussion about Cherokee language translation processes, and audio recordings.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The collaborators also facilitated a conversation about Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW), which was an opportunity to suggest and implement changes to DAILP's website's features and goals. The purpose of the visit was to further shape DAILP into an accessible resource for those with any level of experience with the Cherokee language. The meeting also elicited a sense of familial history, generational purpose, and collaborative relationships that may have never been possible if not for the sense of</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">teamwork and cooperation among all members of those in attendance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pritchett's reading of </span><a href=""https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/15492875""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jennie Sawney's translated letter</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> during the visit was significantly memorable for Ernestine Berry.</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ""Jennie was my grandfather's mother. Jennie's father, James Vann, was a Captain in the Union Army. He served with the Indian Home Guard out of Kansas during the American Civil War… In the letter, Jennie talks about her son, my grandpa, Tsan Wen, and his sister, my great-Aunt Susani.""</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> As her great-grandmother's words were spoken from the mouth of a fellow UKB citizen, in a shared space of revelation and discovery, collaborators all came to understand the importance of these translations for the sources of knowledge, family history, and voice as the translations are read aloud! To see Berry's own family in the Sawney letters is exceptionally important to DAILP's goal of revealing, retelling, and honoring the voices of ancestors that are still held dear to members of the Cherokee and Keetoowah communities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clara Proctor</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> re</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marked that, when translating, there is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""often no way to translate the many layers of meaning into English.""</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> The question became apparent: how do we convey the meaning or purpose of an archival document? All participants agreed that a focus on the author's context (including their identity, circumstances of writing a piece, and where they lived) is the first source of understanding, and important in making stories like Sawney's come to life in translation. Bringing these questions to the center stage allowed for members in attendance to further develop DAILP's mission and understand the ethical dilemmas that come with picking various documents, such as original conversations, published or widely circulated works, and hand-selected texts. Additionally, Berry pointed out that knowledge of Cherokee syllabary has dwindled over time due to the ostracization of those who used the language. She related this to her grandmother, who was not allowed to speak her own language in public school as a child. The level of intimacy and value that translating a document entails made our team very conscious of the purpose of gathering together</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to discuss and interact with historical texts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This notion also urged the team to discuss their thoughts on further learning materials for CWKW, with an emphasis on audio cues and repetition, to reinforce clear understanding that will bridge the generational gap between parents who begin teaching their children Cherokee. As stated by Mary Rae, a teacher and DAILP contributor who joined the discussion virtually, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""DAILP gives beginning language learners the opportunity to interact directly with [the] source."" </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Between the audio recordings and the vast amount of conversations that took place between DAILP team and the UKB guests, their combined ideas invoked illumination on important issues regarding the inclusion of all learners of Cherokee while solidifying the true significance of their combined work. Lots of great things are in store for DAILP thanks to the brilliant collaboration of like-minded individuals!</span></p>"
