<p>Our initiative arose from and builds on work originating with indigenous peoples themselves. We closely involve tribal representatives in our design and conduct: our results are theirs. Although DAILP is hosted at Northeastern University, all aspects of the pilot of our site and subsequent use of our infrastructure takes their motivation and momentum from the work already being done by and in close collaboration with members of Indigenous Nations and communities.</p>
<p>DAILP builds on a 2014 IMLS SPARKS Ignition planning grant by Dr. Ellen Cushman with Gordon Henry at Michigan State University, ""Analyzing Ojibwe and Cherokee Manuscripts: Proof of Concept for a Digital Archive."" MSU faculty, tribal representatives, and Cherokee and Ojibwe community members created and tested designs for an interface to facilitate the translation of Cherokee and Ojibwe manuscripts housed in archives and libraries around the country.</p>
<p>In 2015 Cushman joined Northeastern University's English Department and began working with the library's Digital Scholarship Group (DSG) to explore the development of a full-scale archive of Cherokee manuscript documents aimed at language learning and language persistence. Linguistic information donated by the Cherokee Nation and linguists Hiroto Uchihara and Brad Montgomery-Anderson has contributed to the lexical data set that informs DAILP's translation process. In 2017-19, Cushman continued to develop collaborative partnerships with key archives and began the process of securing agreements to use materials at Yale's Beinecke Library. The documents presented in the reading interface of DAILP have been freely translated into English by Ernestine Berry and a team from the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians: Clara Proctor, Oleta Pritchett, Marlene Ballard. In 2021, under a Henry K. Luce Foundation grant, the team gathered initial feedback on the reader interface of DAILP and identified desired features of a collective translation online interface. This interface would facilitate both translation and growth of the current linguistic architecture, expanding the collection.</p>
<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
<p><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/"">Our collection</a> contains five different genres of Cherokee writing, including funeral notices, church notes, letters, stories, and government documents. Each document can be viewed in a multi-layered format that presents layers in increasing detail. From the story, pronunciation, and word parts to detailed linguistic analyses of each word, these documents to help readers better understand how words and phrases are created in the Cherokee language. We are working with tribal community partners, scholars, and archivists to make sure that our reading environment allows users to most effectively discover documents, read source documents and translations, search for words, and explore linguistic information.</p>
<h3>Where We're Headed</h3>
<p>Using the digital environment we've created so far, we will continue to work with both Cherokee community members and our advisory board to improve our understanding of how this online learning space can enhance existing language-related practices. We will also identify additional features that would improve translation, as well as language teaching and learning practices. To ensure that DAILP can be useful to a wide variety of audiences, our planning processes are conducted in collaboration with a variety of Cherokee language translators, readers, writers, and learners.</p>
<p>With support from the Henry K. Luce foundation, we are creating audio recordings of each source text to further enhance the site's documentation and presentation of the Cherokee language. We have also began integrating curricular materials onto our website, including exercises for writing practice alongside key cultural knowledge for understanding Cherokee people and culture. These curricular materials use our historical documents to help learners find, read, write, and understand Cherokee in new ways and will soon be expanded with listening exercises.</p>
<p>With support from the National Archives, we are also creating a digital edited collection titled <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em>. CWKW is rooted in the DAILP manuscript archive and its language data, but presents an expanded collection of documents through a reading framework that foregrounds genre, cultural thematics, scholarly and community contextualization, and commentary.</p>
<p>Our next major goal is to deepen our digital environment with a collaborative translation space where native speakers of the Cherokee language, learners and teachers, and scholars in the field can contribute their knowledge. This will allow users to both annotate documents at the character, word, phrase, and document levels and to discuss these annotations with others as a way of building knowledge and continually developing documentation of the Cherokee language.</p>"

<p>The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence (DAILP) understands language persistence and preservation as mutually sustaining endeavors for Indigenous peoples today. The DAILP team works tirelessly to build and maintain ""a collaborative online space to facilitate communications between indigenous language learners, speakers, and scholars."" DAILP understands that language is more than the words we speak, more than the rules of form and grammar we learn. Languages fundamentally connect people to shared histories, lands, and ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For hundreds of years, European colonists and settlers coming to America have occupied the lands of indigenous peoples. Along with the intrusion of their physical homelands, Indigenous peoples have suffered the everyday erosion of their own languages and with that loss, their lifeways. In 1491, the land of the Americas included over 2,000 indigenous languages to a mere 245, ""65 [of which] are already extinct and 75 are moving in that direction."" And yet, languages remain as their impact is understood to be fundamental to human connection.</p>

<p>Bri Alexander, a research associate at DAILP who works with and is enrolled in the Cherokee Nation and Shawnee Tribe describes the importance of language best: ""Cherokee in particular is very descriptive, and there's a lot more verbs than nouns. So, it's a doing language and a descriptive language. You just relate differently to the world when you're speaking Cherokee."" The Cherokee language emphasizes one's physical movement through the world, appreciating it in a way that is lost in other languages. Through language, we learn how to experience the world and further, how we ourselves fit into it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>John Chewey, a member of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, works with the DAILP team as a translation specialist. As a result of his participation, he has translated words he has never used before; words that have been largely forgotten over time. John Chewey declared that DAILP's digital collection of written Cherokee has helped him expand his knowledge of the language in ways he didn't predict possible. Not only does this practice of preserving indigenous language help non-speakers to familiarize themselves with the language but it also helps lifelong community members reconnect with their roots!&nbsp;</p>

<p>DAILP teams have been guided in their work by the UKB translation team led by Ernestine Berry, Director of the John Hair Cultural Museum and Archive. Their team identified many precious Cherokee language documents; documents ranging from funeral notices to love letters to cultural stories. John Chewey has even recorded audio for some of these stories, really bringing them to life and honoring the cultural significance behind them. Thus, this project also works to bridge the gap between spoken and written language!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next step of DAILP is working to finalize its reading and writing environments and piloting a prototype of the software with Cherokee teachers, learners, and speakers. The ultimate goal is to support the continued persistence of indigenous languages, while also preserving more of the Cherokee language to further unite communities. The DAILP project serves as more than a digital effort to immortalize an indigenous language in danger. It cultivates a community of indigenous community members, scholars, and interested newcomers who want to explore the language together and develop our understanding of what it means to communicate and further, what it means to connect.</p>

"2ba9d756-6d64-4612-924a-33d6cc8ea629","goals","/about/goals","Goals","<p>DAILP stands for 'The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence.' Formerly the Digital Archive of American Indian Language Preservation and Perseverance, our name change reflects our belief that language perseverance and language preservation are closely interconnected and mutually-sustaining efforts, which result in language persistence. Our site presents a proof of concept for DAILP's reading interface using annotated Cherokee documents as a pilot. With the support of our sponsors, we have identified design functions and user configurations in order to create an online interface for community commentary.</p>
<p>The core goals of the Cherokee pilot project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deepen our existing <span style=""color: #9d4b42;"">community-centered design</span> workflows in partnership with the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes and representatives from their language programs. Support sustainable programs of transcription, translation and language learning that build on existing efforts within the Cherokee community.</li>
<li>Expand the number of documents collected in our <span style=""color: #9d4b42;"">digital collection</span> of historical Cherokee manuscripts. Transcribe, translate, and annotate documents to adapt them into resources for language learning and for linguistic and historical research, partnering with formal institutions to support ongoing collection development.</li>
<li>Build off of existing transcriptions and annotations to develop and sustain an online environment for contextualized language learning through a robust technical and informational infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>
<p>In addition to our core team, which consists of Cherokee language experts and linguists, we also work with speakers, archivists, and librarians. We have prototyped an online environment that supports varied reading and language study practices. Our reading interface is enhanced regularly to reflect feedback and recommendations from our team.</p>
<p>The Cherokee community has enhanced DAILP's design, contributing to our site in many ways. DAILP's work since 2015 has focused on developing workflows and infrastructure that align our source texts, translations, and linguistic annotations with descriptive resources and other materials shared with us by the Cherokee tribes and linguistic scholars. We have benefited from free translations of almost 70 Cherokee syllabary documents provided to us by a team of United Keetoowah Band tribal members led by Ernestine Berry and including Clara Proctor, Marlene Ballard, Oletta Pritchett, and the late Opel Foreman. These resources can be referenced from our transcriptions and translations as sources of information about individual words and usage.</p>

We are immensely grateful to be selected as a project that matches the Henry R. Luce Foundation's vision of excellence, equitability, compassion, and community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This grant expands the current work of translation and language learning on </span><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the DAILP site</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to focus on increasing the potential for language learners to become teachers, mentors, and translators of Cherokee in the future by using our interface. We will also share a vision for how our technological platforms can extend beyond the work itself, such as making linguistic history of the language available to learners, teachers, and translators. Finally, we hope to develop the initial aspects of the technology to focus on platforms that embed linguistic information in a context of language learning, translation, and community commentary. In short, we will use the support from the Henry R. Luce Foundation to build the conversation around Cherokee language learning, plan and administer the DAILP interface, develop translation processes, coordinate with pedagogy and mentorship programs, and gather more documents and increase the number of partnerships with institutional collections to expand our digital archive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Beginning in the early 1930s, Cherokee composer and bandleader Carl T. Fischer (1912-1954) was working on a multi-movement orchestral suite called <em>Reflections of an Indian Boy</em>&nbsp; – a project left unfinished after his sudden passing at the age of 41. While his nine-movement composition was never fully completed, a condensed version of the piece for piano was reconstructed from home audio recordings and fully orchestrated, leading to it being recorded on Columbia Records. Over a half of a century later, his grandson, <a href=""https://justinmorell.com/blog/"">Dr. Justin Morell</a>, embarked on a generational, musical mission of his own.</p>

<p>An alum of both California State University East Bay and UCLA, <a href=""https://justinmorell.com/blog/bio/"">Morell comes from a family of guitarists, composers, and musicians</a>, and holds a PhD from the University of Oregon. Currently, Morell teaches a variety of music composition, music theory, and orchestration courses at <a href=""https://www.lvc.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/music/our-faculty/dr-justin-morell/"">Lebanon Valley College</a> in Pennsylvania as an Associate Professor in Music. Morell created an orchestral composition titled ""<a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/"">18 Echoes in Cherokee</a>"", that encompasses DAILP's English translations of the <a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/the-texts/"">Dollie Duncan letters and more</a>. Morell used short excerpts from the collection of letters to illustrate the dialogues in a new light, promote Cherokee language preservation, and commemorate the work of his late grandfather in a creative, meaningful, auditory experience. The concerto is performed and recorded by Grammy-winning trumpeter, <a href=""https://www.johndaversa.com/biography"">John Daversa</a>, and it includes a number of Cherokee vocalist performers and Cherokee instrumentalists. Begun in 2021, the project was finished in 2024 and is now available at: <a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/"">https://www.18echoes.com/</a></p>

<p>In conversation with his grandfather's music, Morell included instrumental movements based on Fischer's original nine movements in <em>Reflections of an Indian Boy</em>. They are paired with vocal movements sung in Cherokee, and will integrate with excerpts of the historical artifacts that DAILP has to offer to emphasize Cherokee language perseverance. ""The Cherokee Project"" is not the first time the California native has experimented with vocalizations in his orchestral compositions; in&nbsp;<em>John Daversa Jazz Orchestra featuring Justin Morell: <a href=""https://www.allwithoutwords.org/""><em>All Without Words: variations inspired by Lore</em></a></em>&nbsp;(2021), which is described as ""a concerto for trumpet with jazz orchestra and choir,"" Morell&nbsp;incorporates vocalizations inspired by his autistic non-verbal son into the music. In addition to DAILP's Dollie Duncan letters, Morell worked with <a href=""https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/slsnyder.aspx"">Dr. Sara Snyder-Hopkins</a>, the Director of the Cherokee Language Program at Western Carolina University, to include more day-to-day historical excerpts into the project. Morell has clarified that the composition does not include any sacred texts of the Cherokee people.</p>

<p>Our team is thrilled to see (and hear!) the music found in Morell's use of the translated <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/dollie-duncan-letters"">Dollie Duncan letters</a>, which have been graciously translated by DAILP translators and community members Clara Proctor and Ernestine Berry.<strong> (</strong>Accredited translators and annotators for all of our documents can be found under the ""view details"" links above each archival document on our site). Morell reached out to DAILP founder Dr. Ellen Cushman in the spring of 2021 to seek permission to use these documents as part of his composition. The ᎨᏳᎠ ᎠᏂᎦᎳᎩ (Dollie Duncan) collection on DAILP includes letters written from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary by ᎠᏉ ᎠᏂᎦ (Walter Duncan) to his mother Dollie with help from his fellow prisoner, ᎠᎵᏣᏤᎩᏍ ᎣᎨᎵ (Following Star). The collection sheds light on Cherokee inmate camaraderie in the 1950s. Morell emphasized that DAILP's interactions with the prisoners' letters would prove to be a vital component to the completion of the musical project.</p>

<p>The DAILP team gladly invites contributions to the collections' translations and other collaborations in the future. In fact, DAILP implemented a Creative Commons license for scholars, composers, and content developers for those who are inspired to use these documents in their own creative ventures. The DAILP team is pleased to share in creative projects like Morell's that seek to enable Cherokee language persistence and community. DAILP plans to continue supporting Morell's creative project, <a href=""https://www.18echoes.com/"">18 Echoes in Cherokee</a>, and assist in helping him achieve his mission of ""celebrating the beauty and complexity of Cherokee culture and language."" </p>"

<p>As is the case with most indigenous languages, the vitality of the Cherokee language has never been more precarious. The COVID pandemic has taken its toll on Cherokee communities by accelerating the already rapid loss of Cherokee speakers. It is becoming increasingly difficult for new learners to find a space where they can practice the language in their everyday life and build a deeper shared understanding of language and culture together. In league with <a href=""https://en.unesco.org/idil2022-2032"">UNESCO's Decade of Indigenous Languages</a> and with our partners in Cherokee communities, we focus on bridging language practice (perseverance) and language documentation (preservation) into language persistence. We build a place where people from all walks of life can come together to speak, listen, read, and write in Cherokee.</p>
<h3>Why DAILP?</h3>
<p>DAILP centers historical documents as part of a vital work of language perseverance. Through detailed translations and linguistic resources, we make these documents accessible for language learning, scholarship, and public history. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use interface that brings together the Cherokee syllabary, English translation, and word-by-word review in ways that support language learners of all levels as they explore these Cherokee writings. We use the Cherokee language resources available to us in print and online modes to further illuminate these historical documents.</p>"

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This May, DAILP had the pleasure of hosting three members of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) on the Boston campus of Northeastern University in Massachusetts. Thanks to the sponsorship of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) grant from the National Archives, DAILP team members and UKB citizens visited together to discuss a variety of language- and community-based practices. Guests included UKB citizens Clara Proctor and Oletta Pritchett, UKB citizen and DAILP advisory board member Ernestine Berry, and DAILP advisory board member Lisa Conathan. Other </span><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/home/team/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">core team members</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of DAILP were present for various parts of the visit to take notes and discuss with our guests. After a warm welcome on the first evening of their arrival, day two laid the foundation for the visit, which consisted of storytelling, a presentation from Berry, discussion about Cherokee language translation processes, and audio recordings.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The collaborators also facilitated a conversation about Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW), which was an opportunity to suggest and implement changes to DAILP's website's features and goals. The purpose of the visit was to further shape DAILP into an accessible resource for those with any level of experience with the Cherokee language. The meeting also elicited a sense of familial history, generational purpose, and collaborative relationships that may have never been possible if not for the sense of</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">teamwork and cooperation among all members of those in attendance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pritchett's reading of </span><a href=""https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/15492875""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jennie Sawney's translated letter</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> during the visit was significantly memorable for Ernestine Berry.</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ""Jennie was my grandfather's mother. Jennie's father, James Vann, was a Captain in the Union Army. He served with the Indian Home Guard out of Kansas during the American Civil War… In the letter, Jennie talks about her son, my grandpa, Tsan Wen, and his sister, my great-Aunt Susani.""</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> As her great-grandmother's words were spoken from the mouth of a fellow UKB citizen, in a shared space of revelation and discovery, collaborators all came to understand the importance of these translations for the sources of knowledge, family history, and voice as the translations are read aloud! To see Berry's own family in the Sawney letters is exceptionally important to DAILP's goal of revealing, retelling, and honoring the voices of ancestors that are still held dear to members of the Cherokee and Keetoowah communities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clara Proctor</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> re</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marked that, when translating, there is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""often no way to translate the many layers of meaning into English.""</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> The question became apparent: how do we convey the meaning or purpose of an archival document? All participants agreed that a focus on the author's context (including their identity, circumstances of writing a piece, and where they lived) is the first source of understanding, and important in making stories like Sawney's come to life in translation. Bringing these questions to the center stage allowed for members in attendance to further develop DAILP's mission and understand the ethical dilemmas that come with picking various documents, such as original conversations, published or widely circulated works, and hand-selected texts. Additionally, Berry pointed out that knowledge of Cherokee syllabary has dwindled over time due to the ostracization of those who used the language. She related this to her grandmother, who was not allowed to speak her own language in public school as a child. The level of intimacy and value that translating a document entails made our team very conscious of the purpose of gathering together</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to discuss and interact with historical texts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This notion also urged the team to discuss their thoughts on further learning materials for CWKW, with an emphasis on audio cues and repetition, to reinforce clear understanding that will bridge the generational gap between parents who begin teaching their children Cherokee. As stated by Mary Rae, a teacher and DAILP contributor who joined the discussion virtually, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""DAILP gives beginning language learners the opportunity to interact directly with [the] source."" </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Between the audio recordings and the vast amount of conversations that took place between DAILP team and the UKB guests, their combined ideas invoked illumination on important issues regarding the inclusion of all learners of Cherokee while solidifying the true significance of their combined work. Lots of great things are in store for DAILP thanks to the brilliant collaboration of like-minded individuals!</span></p>"

<p>Milan has been involved with DAILP since she was first introduced to the project by her linguistics professor in the fall of 2023. Originally, she came to Northeastern to study physics with the goal of going to medical school, a journey that took her from the physics department to the biology department and finally, to her home in the linguistics department. She finds that linguistics perfectly marries the humanities and the sciences.</p>

<p>Milan has always had a deep fascination with words and language. Milan's mom would bring her to programs at their local library and read stories to her at bedtime. When her mom eventually retires, Milan hopes to run her own ""Library on Wheels,"" going to different disadvantaged neighborhoods and bringing books to children who might otherwise not have access to them. Milan came to adore reading because her mom was such a huge activist for her literacy. Milan came to cherish individual words and how they combine to become something more than the sum of their parts; they become language, which she now gets the chance to explore every day with DAILP and in her linguistics major. As well as English, she can speak French and Chinese. </p>

<p>Additionally, she is involved in the Northeastern Linguistics Club and Health Disparities Collaborative, a group focused on minimizing health disparities across the globe. In Summer of 2024, she traveled to Scotland to explore the Gaelic language, which, though impacted by colonial legacies, is currently experiencing a resurgence around the globe. It was here she fell in love with travel. She imagines herself traveling all over the world, learning language after language after language.</p>

<p>Milan credits her interest in helping historically silenced communities to her own experience growing up in Long Island, New York, where she lived in a considerably disadvantaged neighborhood. Having directly experienced the financial limitations of her upbringing, Milan understands just how essential education is for understanding each other across cultures, across linguistic boundaries. Education unites us.</p>

<p>Her involvement with DAILP is wide-ranging! She first began with linguistic glossing and studying translation tables of the Cherokee language. Most recently, she has been integrating our audio files collected from fluent community members into the instructional materials found in <a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw/teaching-learning""><em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em></a>, bringing the magic of spoken word to the website! Her love for the project is clear, in both her words and her actions. She appreciates the opportunity to make an impact on her community, the opportunity to be a part of something bigger than herself, something important and lasting.</p>

<p>Milan is currently applying to graduate schools to continue her linguistic studies. Looking forward, she hopes to become an academic professor, helping others to understand the sheer beauty and importance of sharing culture, sharing traditions, and sharing language.</p>"

Our archive of Cherokee syllabary documents are translated by members of the Cherokee community and speakers of the Cherokee language, as well linguists, professors, students, and scholars from a range of fields. This multidisciplinary, inclusive approach to our team of scholars reflects our value of community in DAILP's role as being an accessible learning tool for all.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We want you to get to know the dedicated people behind this project. How are they interacting with DAILP's work directly in their own lives and communities? To that end, we're pleased to announce our latest story series: </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">DAILP Team Spotlights</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This month, we sat down with core team member </span><b>Hazelyn Aroian</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a second-year CS and English student at Northeastern University. Hazelyn primarily works as DAILP's Web Content Developer for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. She also contributes to many teams central to DAILP's work, including creating the display for curricular materials online, annotating audio files, and working with Rust and SQL to migrate and store data within our database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this spotlight, Hazelyn describes an important experience she had while at </span><a href=""https://wp.dailp.northeastern.edu/stories/ukb-advisory-board-members-translators-discover-family-voices-in-dailps-work/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the UKB visit last May</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, in which the team discovered that the label for a mode of transcription did not accurately reflect the way that most native Cherokee speakers spoke the language. The experience struck Hazelyn, especially as a CS student: certain elements of design can initially seem like a small choice, but these carry important implications or risk assumptions that may not reflect the community accurately. From both technical and communicative points of view, she realized that the interface built between DAILP and UKB citizens is a key factor in the workflow pertaining to her own role at DAILP.</span></p>
<p><b>________</b></p>
<p><strong>Can you describe what took place during the UKB visit?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""During the UKB visit, we had one specific meeting where our development team was showing members various changes to the interface through which we display documents. Though at this point I wasn't doing any work with the development team, I was paying close attention, since the conversation was relevant to the sort of work I'd hopefully be doing in the future. The team began having a discussion about which form of transcription we default to on the website for the Cherokee syllabary, and what we've chosen to label that specific form of transcription. A few members of the UKB brought up where exactly that form of transcription originated from and how it is much more common for Cherokee learners whose first language is English to pronounce words in that way rather than native Cherokee speakers who transcribe the syllabary. For example, take the difference between </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">transliterating Cherokee ᏣᎳᎩ as tsalagi or jalagi. The former spelling is preferred by Cherokee speakers and learners who grew up with that spelling in their homes and communities.</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> We realized we needed to relabel some dropdown menus in order to ensure the distinction was clear.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>What about this particular instance was meaningful to you?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""As a CS major, this exchange really hammered home the fact that people who are developing software or structuring digital spaces, like our digital archive, need to have a very clear idea of the goal or desired outcome, significance, and context behind a project. It showed me how choices that may at first seem inconsequential, such as which mode to default to or what to call an option on a dropdown menu, can powerfully shape [the] beliefs visitors [to] our site may form.""</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I began to </span></i><b><i>realize the type of attention to detail I would need</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to cultivate in order </span></i><b><i>to accurately represent the intent behind a project.</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""</span></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><b>If you could choose ONE takeaway from this visit, what would it be and why do you think it's an important takeaway?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""…As someone writing code or developing a technical solution, a clear understanding of the problem, as well as the wider context of the problem, is essential. I think this is the biggest takeaway, since other takeaways– ways to work with the community in order to develop that wider context, the importance of workplace communication– are kind of informed by the process of gaining that understanding.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>The importance of technical development seems to be complex. What aspects on this front do you think are most important to consider when developing an interface like DAILP's?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""With DAILP in mind, I think it's important to remember who our audience is, and the fact that we are designing our archive with the Cherokee community foremost, but we may also be reaching people who are unfamiliar with Cherokee language or culture.""</span></i></p>
<p><b>As a CS student, what aspects of technical development does DAILP succeed at, from your point of view? How does DAILP approach technical development differently compared to other places, in your experience?</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""I really love how DAILP treats technical development as one very integrated component of a wider approach. Anyone who writes code for DAILP is encouraged to also contribute during wider team meetings when we discuss specific content or project strategy relating to community engagement… This creates a culture where people involved in technical aspects of the project are really thinking about those other aspects as well.""</span></i></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""…</span></i><b><i>we are developing an archive and interface to serve the wider community</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. So, it's not only important that our team has a clear sense of the goal at hand, but that the community understands what options they have through the interface… and [know] our processes and the technology well enough to </span></i><b><i>be empowered to speak up when changes should be made</i></b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.""</span></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><b>As someone who has a hand in both spaces, what can you say about the relationship between technical development and content creation at DAILP?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Something that's been really interesting to me as I've done work for both our content team and development team is recognizing how important accountability and transparency are to each team, [and] how we go about maintaining those common goals in slightly different ways. In terms of technical development, it may mean writing clear code that's easily readable, efficient, and reusable. In terms of content, it means being precise either with visuals or words.</span></i></p>

Meg has been involved with DAILP since January of 2023, when she met Professor Ellen Cushman in her ""Writing Cultures"" class. Despite not being a part of the Cherokee community herself, Meg knows how it feels to be disconnected from your cultural history and native tongue by colonization. Meg's family spans back generations to Irish ancestry. Before British colonization, the people of Ireland spoke Gaelic as their primary language. This colonization brought attempts to exterminate the native language and force the country to assimilate into the English tongue. Meg's parents moved from Ireland to Boston in the 2000s, bringing with them their love of their people and their heritage!&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so, because of her desire to utilize language to cultivate community, Meg was ecstatic when she was presented the opportunity to join the DAILP team! Her passion for the project and its goals has only grown since.</p>

<p>Meg's involvement with DAILP began with becoming familiar with the Cherokee language, correcting discovered errors in the project database based on community feedback. Her role now is more centered around her interest in professional writing, working to craft stories&nbsp; about the project and the amazing, hardworking people that make it all happen! Her stories have ranged from discussing the impact of language preservation on native communities to describing what the team's editors found meaningful from their work!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being interested in writing since childhood, it means a lot to Meg that she has been able to further develop her passion in a way that benefits her and her community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of Meg's family who are still living in Ireland speak Gaelic as their primary language in their household, refusing to let go of their language and history. Meg has always aspired to learn Gaelic; a goal she is only beginning to undertake. She has learned the history that was stolen from the Irish people. She has grown up hearing stories about the devastation that resulted from British colonization and its legacy. Meg's parents recognized the limitations of living in their homeland and made the bold decision to leave. They sought more for their children. Meg understands what it means to have imperial tragedy woven into a culture, language, and history of a people. She's dedicated to working with her team and community members to persist with and document the language with the Cherokee people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writing for DAILP has helped Meg reconnect with her heritage: to understand what was lost, and what can still be recovered. She is beyond proud to be a part of the larger effort to resist language loss: to preserve the words, traditions and stories that define Cherokee culture.&nbsp;</p>"

<p>Mary ᎺᎵ Rae has been key to DAILP's goal of promoting indigenous language learning and persistence. In <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW), </em>she created instructional resources from our translated documents, including learning resources on the syllabary, information about day-to-day words, conversational phrases, and conversation starters. These modules include audio listening labs and are beautifully illustrated and designed. Mary ᎺᎵ Rae, a certified Cherokee language instructor through the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, is a translator and speaker of Cherokee who was recently featured in the <a href=""https://www.cherokeephoenix.org/culture/language/rae-provides-learning-assistance-during-online-cherokee-classes/article_4b4b6ecd-2e2e-4da7-8192-b55874e3623c.html?utm_campaign=blox&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwY2xjawJqN8ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHnIZotQHJThDwimBnNQZgD0kLuxUYA9uPAvnq8V7ZGs4zjWrHFFV6CDvCQHc_aem_hhllQvaUh2ezcLvHXqAJ1g"">Cherokee Phoenix</a> for her support of language learners in their writing and listening comprehension of Cherokee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary ᎺᎵ Rae first started learning Cherokee later in life through her teacher Ed Fields, a Cherokee Nation language instructor, who sparked her dedication to the Cherokee language and community through his teaching process of explaining words from the speakers' point of view, and illustrating Cherokee thinking through storytelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;""And there's so many things he would bring out about the Cherokee language really showing you how the words picture what they're saying,"" Mary ᎺᎵ Rae explained during our interview.<strong> ""</strong>So it gets you out of the habit of thinking, oh, there's an equivalent word for this in English. It translates to this. And sort of helps you to be thinking about when you see or hear that word, you're seeing a picture. And that is extremely unique.""</p>

<p>Her lifelong goal is to think in Cherokee and understand the lens of Cherokee speakers, which translates into her contributions to the DAILP team and its curriculum.&nbsp;Mary ᎺᎵ Rae began with DAILP's curricular materials seven years ago by developing a set of digital lessons out of document translations. For the last 18 months, Mary ᎺᎵ Rae has been developing the audio listening labs during the second phase of the project. She was eager to develop the recordings to go along with the translations in <em><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw/reading-and-writing"">Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</a>. </em>The audio files liven the practice of language with the combination of the audio, writing, archival documentation, and transcription.&nbsp;""It's very important to be able to hear the words and how to pronounce. But it goes way beyond just pronunciation. It's about hearing words in context. Becoming aware of similarities and related words. And this helps you understand without having to grasp after the meanings of every word…. For thousands of years, Cherokee was just spoken and not written. And this is how you learn.""<br><br>The lessons help learners to engage with Cherokee and allow learners, especially second language learners such as herself, to activate their interests and develop their ideas with accessibility. ""It's more about awakening interest. And showing students that their ideas are important too. And they can have their own way to approach Cherokee. There's not just one way to learn. Everybody's different.""&nbsp;Mary ᎺᎵ Rae's work in this way has helped learners by providing new resources and creating a multifaceted, comprehensible space for acquiring knowledge. Her tremendous influence on DAILP's digital collection, <em><a href=""https://dailp.northeastern.edu/collections/cwkw"">Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way (CWKW)</a>, </em>has played a crucial role in shaping DAILP into what it is today. We are honored to have Mary ᎺᎵ Rae within our DAILP community who opens such a pathway to the Cherokee language and learning.</p>

<p>The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence (DAILP) is a project rooted in language but more specifically, the transmission of language. DAILP collects manuscripts containing Cherokee syllabary, meticulously translating their content to English. The digital edited collection, <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em>, contains translations of eighty-seven Cherokee syllabary documents! ""With only about 2,000 native Cherokee speakers, many of whom are in their 70s or older,"" DAILP's manuscript translations serve to connect Cherokee speakers to learners by translating the words and stories of the Cherokee people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pored over by teams of students, linguists and Cherokee community members, the translation of Cherokee manuscripts is only possible through intense collaboration. The translators and editors, who tend to the intricacies of the texts in their untranslated state, play an integral part of this effort to document and practice the Cherokee language. Editors introduce the translations collected in these pages, describing their lasting importance and framing them in Cherokee lifeways and history. Through this transformation, the untold stories of the Cherokee people are formed in vivid detail and lost words are rediscovered!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As co-editors with Ellen Cushman, Rachel Jackson and Ben Fry helped make the <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em> project come to life. </p>

<p>Jackson also communicates her appreciation for the written component of this project. As fewer Cherokee people are able to speak or write Cherokee, practice with the written form of the Cherokee syllabary can be lost through time. Having a digital space dedicated to the preservation of the written syllabary is, according to Jackson, ""innovative and game changing.""&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ben Fry, assistant professor of American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and citizen of the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians, also appreciates what this project means to the greater effort to preserve indigenous language. Fry notes this project's potential to help create ""more pedagogical materials for the classroom."" Arguing that this collection opens up new opportunities for linguistic ""data analysis"" and research of the Cherokee language's ""word order,"" Fry believes the translations of these numerous manuscripts serve as educational materials to further spread knowledge of the Cherokee language! <em>Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way</em> is a project that actively aims to preserve language in a digital and accessible way, focusing on the written syllabary of the Cherokee people to continue learning and teaching the language. Through the collaboration of editors who deeply care about the Cherokee language, DAILP aims to provide ""sustained exposure and accessibility that any scholar, student or any interested community member who can have access to at any time."" In this way, DAILP creates a digital community space for anyone to learn from and read stories unique to the Cherokee people that they can ""relate to and respect.""</p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved with DAILP and when were you introduced to the Cherokee language?</strong><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I was first introduced to the Cherokee language in Spring 2022 when taking my senior seminar course with Dr. Jeffrey Bourns, DAILP's own language specialist. After several months of trial and error to learn the Cherokee syllabary writing system and proper annotation, Jeff suggested that I continue my work throughout the summer. This is when I was introduced to the core team and have been taking on new responsibilities [at DAILP] since. </span></i><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>As a non-native speaker, what challenges have you faced when it comes to learning the Cherokee syllabary?&nbsp; </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most difficult part of learning the syllabary was distinguishing the characters that differed in only one slight shape or directional change. This, paired with the sheer number of characters used (85!), took days of practice and frequent refreshing to memorize. </span></i><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>As a first-time learner, what are some of the positives and negatives to having no background in the language prior to your intensive course?</b> <b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A positive was my lack of knowledge in the language's structure. This made the morphemic segmentation of words much simpler because I was not trying to fit words into a type of ""structure"" that was common to the language. Negatively, I had no mental vocabulary bank when translating individual words, so I had to rely heavily on the Cherokee-English Dictionary, which was very time consuming. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><b>Do you speak (or have studied) any other languages? </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">English is my only fluent language. However, I have gone through four years of Spanish classes and two years of American Sign Language (ASL), which I feel moderately proficient in. Growing up, I was introduced to a handful of simple words in Portuguese and Polish by my parents, but the full languages were unfortunately not passed down to my siblings or me. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><b>What learning tools or techniques have helped you overcome the challenges you mentioned before? Do you have any tricks, tips, or advice for those visiting our site who would like to start learning the Cherokee language and syllabary for the first time?</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As suggested during my seminar course by Jeff (Dr. Bourns), mnemonics! During the first week of the course, we were instructed to pair mental images with names that corresponded to the phonetics of the Syllabary characters. Jeff exemplified this by pairing a picture of Lady </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ga</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ga with her arms out to represent the character /Ꭶ/ 'ga.' This, combined with drilling a long Quizlet flashcard set, made the characters much easier to differentiate. </span></i><b><i><br />
</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b><b>Is there anything you would like to incorporate or contribute to DAILP's interface before your time with us has come to a close? Moreover, are there any ways you think would improve the site in becoming more accessible to first-time learners of Cherokee? </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I would love to spend my remaining time working on publishing new Cherokee texts. It means a great deal to me that my efforts are making these materials more accessible while also preserving the language for years to come.&nbsp;</span></em><b><br />
</b></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><b><i>""…I believe DAILP to be widely accessible in terms of different ages and skill levels due to its various resources under the Tools and Teaching tabs. I would love to incorporate the idea of mnemonics (and that Quizlet set!) to ease learning.""</i></b></h2>

<p><b>As someone who will work with kids in the future, how would you go about introducing the Cherokee syllabary to a child without any background in the language? </b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lots of pictures! When I first learned the English alphabet in my Kindergarten class, we did coloring worksheets where each letter was paired with an animal whose name began with that letter. Developing similar worksheets with animal pictures whose Cherokee names begin with each Syllabary character could be a first step. </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With my potential future career options and my current job as a childhood educator, children are at the heart of what I want to do.&nbsp; Conveniently, mnemonics are excellent educational tools, especially in situations where a child might not have the means to communicate verbally. Using pictures, actions, symbols, or even ASL will help me to better understand their needs and requests wherever I may end up. </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></i><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><b>Do you feel that you contribute to the persistence of people or community as an annotator? What do you think is something others in your field may not realize is important when it comes to translating another community's language?&nbsp; </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I feel that others do not recognize the importance of culturally-specific words or plays on words. During my work, I have picked up on how many Cherokee terms do not have exact equivalents in other languages. You cannot gain fluency from study alone; you must immerse yourself in the language or culture to gain full knowledge.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><b><i>""As an annotator, I also get to incorporate commentary that comes directly from Cherokee speakers and community members. To me, this is the most worthwhile part of what I do, since the annotation not only introduces the language, but adds depth. DAILP gathers direct feedback that teaches the audience about unique cultural terms and generational language change.""</i></b></h2>
