# User Testing

Notes on user testing and feedback gathering.

## Features

Which features I hope to test here:

- Reading a Cherokee story
- Switch between different reading modes
- Matching up a word in the original image
- Finding other instances of a word in the document
- Look up a morpheme in the glossary

## Scenario

What we tell a tester at the beginning of the session.

### Language Learner

I work with the Digital Archive of American Indian Languages Preservation and Perseverence (DAILP) at Northeastern University.
As you may know, we have collected and translated a collection of Cherokee documents, and hope for this collection to be a tool that brings together learners and linguists.
Would you be open to looking at our website, and going through a few tasks to help us figure out how we can best serve your needs?

### Casual Visitor

Is it okay with you if I record this session for record keeping?

I work with the Digital Archive of American Indian Languages Preservation and Perseverence (DAILP) at Northeastern University.
The goal of DAILP is to support the ongoing creation of indigenous peoplesâ€™ knowledge, interpretations, and representations of the past by preserving and analyzing historical texts.
We have collected and translated a collection of Cherokee documents from the early 20th century, and hope for this collection to be a tool that brings together learners and linguists.
I'd like to have you complete a few tasks on our website and ask for your feedback.
I'm not expecting you to have specific knowledge about Cherokee, just curiosity.

## Tasks

This is not a test of you or your abilities, but rather a test of our interface.
If anything is unclear, that is our fault, not yours.
I would like to read you a set of short tasks one at a time that we can use as a starting point.
I want to see where our tool falls short, so if you are confused, tell me what you're thinking.
I will only provide help if you get stuck

Here is the link to the site: https://dailp.northeastern.edu/

1. Find one (Cherokee) document that you are curious about.
2. Read through as much or little of the document/translation as you'd like.
3. Take a stab at speaking a Cherokee word that you see.
4. Figure out the root/meaning of a long word that you see.
5. Find the word you're looking at in the original image.

## Post-test Survey

### Non-speakers

1. What was your initial impression of the site?
   Did that change as you browsed?
2. Was any part of your experience confusing or frustrating?
3. Did you understand the document that you read?
4. Did any of my introduction or task descriptions feel misleading after using the interface?

### Cherokee speakers

1. What was your initial impression of the site?
   Did that change as you browsed?
2. Was any part of your experience confusing or frustrating?
3. How easy was the document to read?
4. Was any provided terminology unclear or unfamiliar?

## Overall Approach

The following is a sketch of how we could approaching stakeholder testing and collaboration.

1. Create multiple interface prototypes for different use cases. (see [Dow et al, 2010](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi94P3PppHsAhWlUt8KHXkUA7oQFjABegQIBBAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fspdow.ucsd.edu%2Ffiles%2FPrototypingParallel-TOCHI10.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3Y9g1TBANvYS0fiy9-50dH) for the value of parallel prototyping)
2. Present all prototypes together to stakeholders in each interest group: learners, experienced speakers, annotators, linguists, etc.
3. Let them play around themselves in the interface. Show and tell can only go so far, and letting stakeholders interact directly with our work will give us much more valuable discussion and feedback.
4. Ask them each questions about their experience, here are some examples:
   - "Would you use this?"
   - "Did one of these interfaces feel more intuitive or useful to you?"
   - "How could each interface be better?"
   - "Does this serve your needs as an X?"
   - "Does this respect your community and position in that community?"
5. Not only on their experience, but solicit feedback on how they themselves and tech-literate members of their community would feel most comfortable contributing to and participating in further development.
   Then we can change our process to facilitate that kind of involvement.
6. Iterate on all of the prototypes separately based on the feedback received.
7. Involve some of the same people and some new people in testing out these refined prototypes, to recognize where we've improved (or not) and where we stand in fresh eyes.
8. Consolidate these prototypes where possible while providing these same stakeholders with a link to our active working primary interface, and to our GitHub repository.
9. Solicit feedback on a single refined prototype that will become the production release candidate.
