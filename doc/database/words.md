## `word_contributor_media`

A join table linking user audio contributions to words in documents. This is a many-to-many relationship, so should be indexed on both keys, with a compound unique constraint. Ie. you cannot link the same audio to the same word multiple times. Additions should be written as upserts.

| column           | type                  | description                              |

| `word_id`        | `uuid -> word`        | Word that is assocated with media slice. |
| `media_slice_id` | `uuid -> media_slice` | Media slice that is assocated with word. |

## `word_segment`

A part of a word, also known as a morpheme within a morphemic segmentation.
Generally used to display interlinear glossed text.

Word segments are unique on the combination of `word_id` and `index_in_word`.

| column          | type                      | description                                                                                                                                   |

| `word_id`       | `uuid -> word`            | Word this is a part of                                                                                                                        |
| `index_in_word` | `bigint`                  | Position within the word                                                                                                                      |
| `morpheme`      | `text`                    | Underlying phonemic representation of the morpheme                                                                                            |
| `gloss_id`      | `uuid? -> morpheme_gloss` | English gloss which may be shared with other word segments                                                                                    |
| `role`          | `word_segment_role`       | Role of the segment within the word, either `Morpheme`, `Clitic`, or `Modifier`. This usually determines the separator character used in IGT. |

## `morpheme_gloss`

Used for glossing related morphemes within a document.
So within `WJ46`, if I want to gloss two words as "walk" because they are the
same lexical unit, then both words use the same `morpheme_gloss` row.
For example, one might be `WJ46:walk` which displays as "walk" within that document.

Each value of `gloss` is unique within its parent document.

| column          | type                             | description                                           |

| `document_id`   | `uuid? -> document`              | If non-null, this gloss is scoped within the document |
| `gloss`         | `text`                           | English gloss used in linguistic analysis             |
| `example_shape` | `text?`                          | Optional romanized example of the underlying morpheme |
| `tag_id`        | `uuid? -> abstract_morpheme_tag` | Optional associated functional morpheme tag           |

## `abbreviation_system`

A linguistic system for displaying morphemic segmentations of each word.
Each system has a different mapping of internal morpheme glosses to display morphemes.

| column       | type   | description                                                                                      |

| `short_name` | `text` | Natural key, like "CRG". Once we have live data, either remove this field or make it non-unique. |
| `title`      | `text` | Full title of the system, like "Cherokee Reference Grammar"                                      |
