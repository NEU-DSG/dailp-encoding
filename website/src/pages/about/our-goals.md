# Our Goals

The Digital Archive for American Indian Languages Preservation and Perseverance (DAILP) focuses on both language perseverance and language preservation treating them as closely interconnected and mutually sustaining efforts. The core goals of the project are:

1. Develop a **community-centered design** in partnership with the Cherokee Nationâ€™s own programs of language learning and perseverance.
2. Develop and sustain an **online environment for language learning** through transcribing, translating, and contextualizing historical Cherokee language documents, and a robust technical and informational infrastructure.
3. Develop an extensive **digital collection** of historical Cherokee manuscripts with transcriptions, translations, and annotations as a resource for language learning and for linguistic and historical research, and formal institutional partnerships to support ongoing collection development.
4. Develop and support sustainable programs of **transcription, translation and language learning** that build on existing efforts within the Cherokee community.
