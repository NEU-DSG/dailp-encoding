# About DAILP

DAILP is a community-based digital archive created to support the ongoing creation of indigenous peoplesâ€™ knowledge, interpretations, and representations of the past.
DAILP will be a collaborative place for indigenous language learners, speakers, and scholars to translate documents and other media across American Indian languages.
[The DAILP team](/about/our-team) is developing a prototype of this translation space using a selection of handwritten documents in the Cherokee syllabary that have been translated using an online lexical data set drawn from the contributions of Cherokee linguists in our collective.
